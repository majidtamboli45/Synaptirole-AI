# Wildcards in Java

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/wildcards-in-java/

Wildcards in Java Generics allow you to work with unknown types in a flexible and type-safe way. They are represented using the ? symbol and help in writing reusable code that can handle different generic types.
- Used when the exact type of a generic parameter is not known in advance
- Commonly applied in method arguments to increase flexibility
- Helps maintain type safety while working with collections of different types
Types of wildcards in Java
In Java, wildcards are mainly classified into three types based on how they define type flexibility and restrictions.
1. Upper Bounded Wildcards
These wildcards can be used when you want to relax the restrictions on a variable. For example, say you want to write a method that works on List < Integer >, List < Double > and List < Number >, you can do this using an upper bounded wildcard.
To declare an upper-bounded wildcard, use the wildcard character ('?'), followed by the extends keyword, followed by its upper bound.
public static void add(List<? extends Number> list)
Implementation:
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
class WildcardDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Upper Bounded Integer List
        List<Integer> list1 = Arrays.asList(4, 5, 6, 7);
        System.out.println("Total sum is:" + sum(list1));
        // Double list
        List<Double> list2 = Arrays.asList(4.1, 5.1, 6.1);
        System.out.print("Total sum is:" + sum(list2));
    }
    private static double sum(List<? extends Number> list)
    {
        double sum = 0.0;
        for (Number i : list) {
            sum += i.doubleValue();
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
Output
Total sum is:22.0
Total sum is:15.299999999999999
Explanation: In the above program, list1 holds Integer values and list2 holds Double values. Both are passed to the sum method, which uses a wildcard <? extends Number>. This means it can accept any list of a type that is a subclass of Number, like Integer or Double.
2. Lower Bounded Wildcards
It is expressed using the wildcard character ('?'), followed by the super keyword, followed by its lower bound: <? super A>.
Syntax: Collectiontype <? super A>
Implementation:
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
class WildcardDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Lower Bounded Integer List
        List<Integer> list1 = Arrays.asList(4, 5, 6, 7);
        // Integer list object is being passed
        printOnlyIntegerClassorSuperClass(list1);
        // Number list
        List<Number> list2 = Arrays.asList(4, 5, 6, 7);
        // Integer list object is being passed
        printOnlyIntegerClassorSuperClass(list2);
    }
    public static void printOnlyIntegerClassorSuperClass(
        List<? super Integer> list)
    {
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}
Output
[4, 5, 6, 7]
[4, 5, 6, 7]
Explanation: Here, the method printOnlyIntegerClassorSuperClass accepts only Integer or its superclasses (like Number). If you try to pass a list of Double, it gives a compile-time error because Double is not a superclass of Integer.
Note: Use extend wildcard when you want to get values out of a structure and super wildcard when you put values in a structure. Don’t use wildcard when you get and put values in a structure. You can specify an upper bound for a wildcard or you can specify a lower bound, but you cannot specify both.
3. Unbounded Wildcard
This wildcard type is specified using the wildcard character (?), for example, List. This is called a list of unknown types. These are useful in the following cases -
- When writing a method that can be employed using functionality provided in Object class.
- When the code is using methods in the generic class that doesn't depend on the type parameter
Implementation:
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
class unboundedwildcardemo {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Integer List
        List<Integer> list1 = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3);
        // Double list
        List<Double> list2 = Arrays.asList(1.1, 2.2, 3.3);
        printlist(list1);
        printlist(list2);
    }
    private static void printlist(List<?> list)
    {
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}
Output
[1, 2, 3]
[1.1, 2.2, 3.3]
