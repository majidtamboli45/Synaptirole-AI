# Iterator in Java

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/iterators-in-java/

An Iterator in Java is one of the most commonly used cursors in the Java Collections Framework. It is used to traverse or iterate through elements of a collection one by one.
- It is used to traverse elements in the forward direction only.
- Removes elements safely during traversal using remove().
- Iterator is a universal cursor that applies to most collection types such as List, Set, and Queue.
- Although Map is part of the Java Collections Framework, it is not a subtype of the Collection interface.
- However, iterators can still be used with Map through keySet(), values(), or entrySet().
Declaration of Iterator
public interface Iterator<E>
Here, E represents the type of elements to be iterated over.
Object Creation of Iterator
An Iterator object is created by calling the iterator() method on a collection object. Here, we will use an Iterator to traverse and print each element in an ArrayList.
Collection<String> names = new ArrayList<>();
Iterator<String> itr = names.iterator();
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Iterator;
public class Geeks {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      
        // Create an ArrayList and add some elements
        ArrayList<String> al = new ArrayList<>();
        al.add("A");
        al.add("B");
        al.add("C");
        // Obtain an iterator for the ArrayList
        Iterator<String> it = al.iterator();
        // Iterate through the elements and print each one
        while (it.hasNext()) {
          
            // Get the next element
            String n = it.next(); 
            System.out.println(n);      
        }
    }
}
Output
A
B
C
Hierarchy of Iterator
- Iterator is part of the java.util package and is used by collection classes to traverse elements.
- Collection classes implement the Iterable interface, which provides the iterator() method that returns an Iterator object.
Methods of Iterator Interface
The iterator interface defines three methods as listed below:
- hasNext(): Returns true if the iteration has more elements.
- next(): Returns the next element in the iteration. It throws NoSuchElementException if no more element is present.
- remove():  Removes the last element returned by next(). This method can be called only once per call to next().Calling it more than once without calling next() will throw IllegalStateException .
Iterator<Integer> it = list.iterator();
it.next();
it.remove();  // Works fine
it.remove();  // Throws IllegalStateException
Note: remove() method can throw two exceptions namely as follows:
- UnsupportedOperationException : if the remove operation is not supported by this iterator
- IllegalStateException : if remove() is called before next() or more than once per next() call
- Internal Working
In this section, we will try to understand how Java Iterator and its methods work internally. Let us take the following LinkedList object to understand this functionality.
Step 1: Now, let us create an Iterator object on the List object as shown below:
Iterator<String> citiesIterator = cities.iterator();
The "citiesIterator" iterator will look like below:
Here Iterator’s Cursor is pointing before the first element of the List.
Step 2: Now, we will run the following code snippet.
citiesIterator.hasNext();
citiesIterator.next();
When we run the above code snippet, Iterator’s Cursor points to the first element in the list as shown in the above diagram.
Step 3: Now, we will run the following code snippet.
citiesIterator.hasNext();
citiesIterator.next();
When we run the above code snippet, Iterator’s Cursor points to the second element in the list as shown in the above diagram. 
Step 4: Do this process to reach the Iterator’s Cursor to the end element of the List.
Step 5: After reading the final element, if we run the below code snippet, it returns a “false” value.
citiesIterator.hasNext();
As Iterator’s Cursor points to the after the final element of the List, hasNext() method returns a false value.
Note: Java Iterator supports only forward direction iteration, so it is known as a uni-directional cursor. In contrast, ListIterator is bi-directional, allowing traversal in both directions.
Example: Here, we will use an Iterator to traverse and remove odd elements from an ArrayList.
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Iterator;
public class Geeks {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // Creating an ArrayList of Integer type
        ArrayList<Integer> al = new ArrayList<>();
        // Adding elements to the ArrayList
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            al.add(i);
        }
        // Printing the original list
        System.out.println("Original List: " + al);
        // Creating an Iterator for the ArrayList
        Iterator<Integer> itr = al.iterator();
        // Iterating through the list and removing odd elements
        while (itr.hasNext()) {
          
            // Getting the next element
            int i = itr.next();  
            
            System.out.print(i + " ");  
            // Removing odd elements
            if (i % 2 != 0) {
                itr.remove();
            }
        }
        System.out.println();
        // Printing the modified list after removal of odd elements
        System.out.println("Modified List: " + al);
    }
}
Output
Original List: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
Modified List: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
Explanation: In the above example, we create an ArrayList of integers then iterates through it using an Iterator and removes all odd numbers. It prints the list before and after removing the odd elements and prints the modified list with only even numbers.
