# java.time.Period Class in Java

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/java-time-period-class-in-java/

The Period class in the java.time package, introduced in Java 8, represents a date-based amount of time in terms of years, months, and days. It is commonly used to calculate the difference between two dates or to add and subtract date-based values from a date.
- Represents a period using years, months, and days.
- Immutable and thread-safe.
- Useful for date calculations such as age, subscription duration, and project timelines.
import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.time.Period;
public class Geeks {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LocalDate start = LocalDate.of(2022, 1, 1);
        LocalDate end = LocalDate.of(2025, 7, 9);
        Period period = Period.between(start, end);
        System.out.println("Years : " + period.getYears());
        System.out.println("Months: " + period.getMonths());
        System.out.println("Days  : " + period.getDays());
    }
}
Output
Years : 3
Months: 6
Days  : 8
Explanation: The between() method calculates the difference between two dates and returns it as a Period object containing years, months, and days.
Syntax
public final class Period extends Object implements ChronoPeriod, Serializable

| hashCode() | This method returns a hash code for this period. | 
| isNegative() | This method checks if any of the three units of this period are negative. | 
| isZero() | This method checks if all three units of this period are zero. | 
| minus(TemporalAmount amountToSubtract) | This method returns a copy of this period with the specified period subtracted. | 
| minusDays(long daysToSubtract) | This method returns a copy of this period with the specified days subtracted. | 
| minusMonths(long monthsToSubtract) | This method returns a copy of this period with the specified months subtracted. | 
| minusYears(long yearsToSubtract) | This method returns a copy of this period with the specified years subtracted. | 
| multipliedBy(int scalar) | This method returns a new instance with each element in this period multiplied by the specified scalar. | 
| negated() | This method returns a new instance with each amount in this period negated. | 
| normalized() | This method returns a copy of this period with the years and months normalized. | 
| of(int years, int months, int days) | This method obtains a Period representing a number of years, months, and days. | 
| ofDays(int days) | This method obtains a Period representing a number of days. | 
| ofMonths(int months) | This method obtains a Period representing a number of months. | 
| ofWeeks(int weeks) | This method obtains a Period representing a number of weeks. | 
| ofYears(int years) | This method obtains a Period representing a number of years. | 
| parse(CharSequence text) | This method obtains a Period from a text string such as PnYnMnD. | 
| plus(TemporalAmount amountToAdd) | This method returns a copy of this period with the specified period added. | 
| plusDays(long daysToAdd) | This method returns a copy of this period with the specified days added. | 
| plusMonths(long monthsToAdd) | This method returns a copy of this period with the specified months added. | 
| plusYears(long yearsToAdd) | This method returns a copy of this period with the specified years added. | 
| subtractFrom(Temporal temporal) | This method subtracts this period from the specified temporal object. | 
| toString() | This method outputs this period as a String, such as P6Y3M1D. | 
| toTotalMonths() | This method gets the total number of months in this period. | 
| withDays(int days) | This method returns a copy of this period with the specified amount of days. | 
| withMonths(int months) | This method returns a copy of this period with the specified amount of months. | 
| withYears(int years) | This method returns a copy of this period with the specified amount of years. | 
Approach
- Import the java.time.Period and java.time.LocalDate classes.
- Create a Period object using methods such as of(), ofDays(), or between().
- Perform date calculations or modify existing periods.
- Display the resulting period or updated date.
Example 1: Using ofMonths() and minus()
import java.time.Period;
public class Geeks {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a period of 6 months
        Period p1 = Period.ofMonths(6);
        // Subtract 2 months
        Period p2 = p1.minus(Period.ofMonths(2));
        System.out.println(p2);
    }
}
Output
P4M
Explanation: The ofMonths(6) method creates a period of 6 months. The minus() method subtracts 2 months, resulting in a period of 4 months (P4M).
Example 2: Using ofDays() and addTo()
import java.time.*;
import java.time.temporal.Temporal;
public class Geeks {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a period of 24 days
        Period period = Period.ofDays(24);
        // Add the period to the current date
        Temporal result = period.addTo(LocalDate.now());
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
Output
2026-08-02
Explanation: The ofDays(24) method creates a period of 24 days. The addTo() method adds this period to the current date and returns the updated date.
Advantages of Period Class
- Represents date-based durations using years, months, and days.
- Simplifies date calculations between two dates.
- Immutable and thread-safe.
- Provides convenient methods for adding and subtracting date-based values.
- Integrates seamlessly with other classes in the java.time API.
