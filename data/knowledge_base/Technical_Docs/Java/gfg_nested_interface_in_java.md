# Nested Interface in Java

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/nested-interface-in-java/

In Java, a Nested Interface is an interface declared inside a class or another interface. In Java, nested interfaces can be declared with the public, protected, package-private (default), or private access specifiers.
- Inside a class, it can be public, protected, default, or private.
- Inside another interface, it is implicitly public and static.
- A top-level interface can only be public or default (package-private).
There are two types of nested interfaces in Java
1. Nested Interface Inside a Class
When an interface is declared inside a class, it can have any access modifier. To implement it, you must qualify it with the outer class name.
class Outer {
    interface Inner {
        void display();
    }
}
class GFG implements Outer.Inner{
    
    public void display(){
        
        System.out.println(
            "Hello from Nested Interface Inside a Class!");
    }
    public static void main(String[] args){
        
        Outer.Inner obj = new GFG();
        obj.display();
    }
}
Output
Hello from Nested Interface Inside a Class!
Explanation:
- The interface Inner is nested inside the class Outer.
- The class GFG implements Outer.Inner.
- The method display() is defined and called through the interface reference.
2. Nested Interface Inside an Interface
When an interface is declared inside another interface, it is implicitly public and static, even if not explicitly declared.
interface OuterInterface {
    void show();
    interface InnerInterface {
        void msg();
    }
}
class Test implements OuterInterface.InnerInterface {
    public void msg()
    {
        System.out.println(
            "Message from Nested Interface Inside an Interface!");
    }
    public static void main(String[] args){
        
        OuterInterface.InnerInterface obj = new Test();
        obj.msg();
    }
}
Output
Message from Nested Interface Inside an Interface!
Explanation:
- The InnerInterface is defined inside OuterInterface.
- Since nested interfaces inside another interface are public static by default, Test can directly implement it.
- The fully qualified name OuterInterface.InnerInterface is used to refer to it.
Key Rules of Nested Interfaces
- Inside a Class: A nested interface can be public, protected, package-private (default), or private.
- Inside an Interface: It is implicitly public and static, even if not explicitly mentioned.
- Top-Level Interfaces: A top-level interface (not nested) can only be public or package-private (default), it cannot be protected or private.
Example: Interface cannot have non-public member interface
import java.util.*;
interface Parent{
    
    protected interface Test{
        
        void show();
    }
}
class Child implements Parent.Test{
    
    public void show(){
        
        System.out.println("show method of interface");
    }
}
class Geeks{
    
    public static void main(String[] args){
        
        Parent.Test obj;
        Child t = new Child();
        obj = t;
        obj.show();
    }
}

Uses of Nested Interfaces
In Java, nested interfaces can be used for a variety of purposes, including:
- Organizing Code: Grouping related interfaces improves structure and readability.
- Controlled Access: Nesting an interface inside a class limits its visibility, enhancing safety.
- Callbacks: Enables one object to pass itself to another for method invocation.
- Defining Contracts: Multiple classes can implement the same interface with their own versions, ensuring consistent behavior.
