# Inheritance in Java

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/inheritance-in-java/

Inheritance in Java is a core OOP concept that allows a class to acquire properties and behaviors from another class. It helps in creating a new class from an existing class, promoting code reusability and better organization.
- A subclass can reuse the fields and methods of the parent class without rewriting the code
- A subclass can add its own fields and methods or modify existing ones to extend functionality.
// Parent class
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}
// Child class
class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
// Child class
class Cat extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows");
    }
}
// Child class
class Cow extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Cow moos");
    }
}
// Main class
public class Geeks {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a;
        a = new Dog();
        a.sound();  
        a = new Cat();
        a.sound(); 
        a = new Cow();
        a.sound();  
    }
}
Output
Dog barks
Cat meows
Cow moos
Explanation:
- Animal is the base class.
- Dog, Cat and Cow are derived classes that extend Animal class and provide specific implementations of the sound() method.
- The Geeks class is the driver class that creates objects and demonstrates runtime polymorphism using method overriding.
Note: The sound() method is an instance method, so it is called using an object reference. Here, new Dog() creates a Dog object, and its reference is assigned to the Animal reference a. When a.sound() is called, Java executes the overridden Dog version of sound() at runtime.
Syntax:
class Parent {
  // fields and methods
 }
class Child extends Parent {
// additional fields and methods
}
Note: In Java, inheritance is implemented using the extends keyword.
Key Terminologies in Java Inheritance
- Class : Blueprint from which objects are created
- Superclass : Class whose properties are inherited
- Subclass : Class that inherits another class
- extends : Keyword used to inherit a class
Types of Inheritance in Java
It defines the different ways a class can inherit properties and behavior from one or more classes.
Below are the different types of inheritance which are supported by Java.
1. Single Inheritance
In single inheritance, a sub-class is derived from only one super class. It inherits the properties and behavior of a single-parent class. Sometimes, it is also known as simple inheritance.
//Super class
class Vehicle {
    Vehicle() {
        System.out.println("This is a Vehicle");
    }
}
// Subclass 
class Car extends Vehicle {
    Car() {
        System.out.println("This Vehicle is Car");
    }
}
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating object of subclass invokes base class constructor
        Car obj = new Car();
    }
}
Output
This is a Vehicle
This Vehicle is Car
2. Multilevel Inheritance
In Multilevel Inheritance, a derived class will be inheriting a base class and as well as the derived class also acts as the base class for other classes.
class Vehicle {
    Vehicle() {
        System.out.println("This is a Vehicle");
    }
}
class FourWheeler extends Vehicle {
    FourWheeler() {
        System.out.println("4 Wheeler Vehicles");
    }
}
class Car extends FourWheeler {
    Car() {
        System.out.println("This 4 Wheeler Vehicle is a Car");
    }
}
public class Geeks {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car obj = new Car(); // Triggers all constructors in order
    }
}
Output
This is a Vehicle
4 Wheeler Vehicles
This 4 Wheeler Vehicle is a Car
3. Hierarchical Inheritance
In hierarchical inheritance, more than one subclass is inherited from a single base class. i.e. more than one derived class is created from a single base class. For example, cars and buses both are vehicle
class Vehicle {
    Vehicle() {
        System.out.println("This is a Vehicle");
    }
}
class Car extends Vehicle {
    Car() {
        System.out.println("This Vehicle is Car");
    }
}
class Bus extends Vehicle {
    Bus() {
        System.out.println("This Vehicle is Bus");
    }
}
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car obj1 = new Car(); 
        Bus obj2 = new Bus(); 
    }
}
Output
This is a Vehicle
This Vehicle is Car
This is a Vehicle
This Vehicle is Bus
4. Multiple Inheritance (Through Interfaces)
In Multiple inheritances, one class can have more than one superclass and inherit features from all parent classes.
Note: that Java does not support multiple inheritances with classes. In Java, we can achieve multiple inheritances only through Interfaces.
interface LandVehicle {
    default void landInfo() {
        System.out.println("This is a LandVehicle");
    }
}
interface WaterVehicle {
    default void waterInfo() {
        System.out.println("This is a WaterVehicle");
    }
}
// Subclass implementing both interfaces
class AmphibiousVehicle implements LandVehicle, WaterVehicle {
    AmphibiousVehicle() {
        System.out.println("This is an AmphibiousVehicle");
    }
}
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AmphibiousVehicle obj = new AmphibiousVehicle();
        obj.waterInfo();
        obj.landInfo();
    }
}
Output
This is an AmphibiousVehicle
This is a WaterVehicle
This is a LandVehicle
5. Hybrid Inheritance
It is a mix of two or more of the above types of inheritance. In Java, we can achieve hybrid inheritance only through Interfaces if we want to involve multiple inheritance to implement Hybrid inheritance.
// Superclass
class Vehicle {
    void vehicleType() {
        System.out.println("This is a Vehicle");
    }
}
// Interface for fare
interface Fare {
    default void fareInfo() {
        System.out.println("Fare information");
    }
}
// Subclass 1: Single inheritance + multilevel
class Car extends Vehicle {
    void carType() {
        System.out.println("This is a Car");
    }
}
// Subclass 2: Hybrid inheritance (extends class + implements interface)
class Bus extends Vehicle implements Fare {
    void busType() {
        System.out.println("This is a Bus");
    }
}
public class GFG{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car();
        car.vehicleType(); // inherited from Vehicle
        car.carType();     // specific to Car
        Bus bus = new Bus();
        bus.vehicleType(); // inherited from Vehicle
        bus.busType();     // specific to Bus
        bus.fareInfo();    // from Fare interface
    }
}
Output
This is a Vehicle
This is a Car
This is a Vehicle
This is a Bus
Fare information
Explanation:
- class Car extends Vehicle->Single Inheritance
- class Bus extends Vehicle and class Bus implements Interface Fare->Hybrid Inheritance (since Bus inherits from two sources, forming a combination of single + multiple inheritance).
Java IS-A type of Relationship
IS-A represents an inheritance relationship in Java, meaning this object is a type of that object.
public class SolarSystem {
}
public class Earth extends SolarSystem {
}
public class Mars extends SolarSystem {
}
public class Moon extends Earth {
}
Now, based on the above example, in Object-Oriented terms, the following are true:
- SolarSystem is the superclass of Earth class.
- SolarSystem is the superclass of Mars class.
- Earth and Mars are subclasses of SolarSystem class.
- Moon is the subclass of both Earth and SolarSystem classes.
class SolarSystem {
}
class Earth extends SolarSystem {
}
class Mars extends SolarSystem {
}
public class Moon extends Earth {
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        SolarSystem s = new SolarSystem();
        Earth e = new Earth();
        Mars m = new Mars();
        System.out.println(s instanceof SolarSystem);
        System.out.println(e instanceof Earth);
        System.out.println(m instanceof SolarSystem);
    }
}
Output
true
true
true
What Can Be Done in a Subclass?
In sub-classes we can inherit members as is, replace them, hide them or supplement them with new members:
- The inherited fields can be used directly, just like any other fields.
- We can declare new fields in the subclass that are not in the superclass.
- The inherited methods can be used directly as they are.
- We can write a new instance method in the subclass that has the same signature as the one in the superclass, thus overriding it (as in the example above, toString() method is overridden).
- We can write a new static method in the subclass that has the same signature as the one in the superclass, thus hiding it.
- We can declare new methods in the subclass that are not in the superclass.
- We can write a subclass constructor that invokes the constructor of the superclass, either implicitly or by using the keyword super.
Advantages of Inheritance in Java
- Code Reusability: Inheritance allows for code reuse and reduces the amount of code that needs to be written. The subclass can reuse the properties and methods of the superclass, reducing duplication of code.
- Abstraction: Inheritance allows for the creation of abstract classes that define a common interface for a group of related classes. This promotes abstraction and encapsulation, making the code easier to maintain and extend.
- Class Hierarchy: Inheritance allows for the creation of a class hierarchy, which can be used to model real-world objects and their relationships.
- Polymorphism: Inheritance allows for polymorphism, which is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. Subclasses can override the methods of the superclass, which allows them to change their behavior in different ways.
Limitations of Inheritance in Java
- Complexity -> Deep inheritance hierarchies can make code hard to understand . Correction -> keep hierarchy simple or use composition instead
- Tight Coupling -> Changes in superclass can affect subclasses . Correction -> use loose coupling (interfaces or composition)
