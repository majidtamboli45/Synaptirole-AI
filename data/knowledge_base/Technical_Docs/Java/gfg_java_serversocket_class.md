# Java ServerSocket Class

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/java-net-serversocket-class-in-java/

ServerSocket in Java is used to create server-side socket connections in a client–server model. It allows a server to listen for incoming client requests on a specific port and throws an exception if the port is unavailable.
- Provides a system-independent way to implement server-side networking.
- In java.nio.channels, it is associated with a ServerSocketChannel.
- In java.rmi.server, it creates server sockets for RMI communication.
- In javax.net, it supports creating unbound sockets or sockets bound to a port with optional backlog and local IP settings.

            // Create a ServerSocket listening on port 6666
            ServerSocket ss = new ServerSocket(6666);
            System.out.println("Server started. Listening on port 6666...");
            // Accept a connection from a client
            Socket s = ss.accept();
            System.out.println("Client connected!");
            // Read the message from the client
            DataInputStream d = new DataInputStream(s.getInputStream());
            String str = d.readUTF();
            System.out.println("Message: " + str);
            // Close the socket
            ss.close();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Server Error: " + e);
        }
    }
}
Output:
Explanation: In the above example, it demonstrates a basic server-side implementation using the ServerSocket class. It listens on port 6666, accepts a client connection, reads a message sent by the client, and then closes the connection.

public class MyClient {
    // Main driver method
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Try block to check if exception occurs
        try {
            // Creating Socket class object and
            // initializing Socket
            Socket s = new Socket("localhost", 6666);
            DataOutputStream d = new DataOutputStream(
                s.getOutputStream());
            // Message to be displayed
            d.writeUTF("Hello GFG Readers!");
            // Flushing out internal buffers,
            // optimizing for better performance
            d.flush();
            // Closing the connections
            // Closing DataOutputStream
            d.close();
            // Closing socket
            s.close();
        }
        // Catch block to handle exceptions
        catch (Exception e) {
            // Print the exception on the console
            System.out.println(e);
        }
    }
}
Output:
Explanation: In the above example, it demonstrates a basic client-side implementation using the Socket class. It connects to a server at localhost on port 6666, sends a message "Hello GFG Readers!", and then closes the connection.
Methods of Java ServerSocket
| Method | Description | 
|---|---|
| accept() | Listens for a connection to be made to this socket and accepts it. | 
| bind(SocketAddress endpoint) | Binds the ServerSocket to a specific address (IP address and port number). | 
| bind(SocketAddress endpoint, int backlog) | Binds the ServerSocket to a specific address (IP address and port number) and requests queqe length. If a request arrives when the queue is full then the request will be rejected by the server. | 
| close() | Closes this socket | 
| getChannel() | Returns the unique ServerSocketChannel object associated with this socket, if any. | 
| getInetAddress() | Returns the local address of this server socket. | 
| getLocalPort() | Returns the port number on which this socket is listening. | 
| getLocalSocketAddress() | Returns the address of the endpoint this socket is bound to, or null if it is not bound yet. | 
| getReceiveBufferSize() | Gets the value of the SO_RCVBUF option for this ServerSocket, that is the proposed buffer size that will be used for Sockets accepted from this ServerSocket. | 
| getReuseAddress() | Tests if SO_REUSEADDR is enabled. | 
| getSoTimeout() | Retrieve setting for SO_TIMEOUT. | 
| implAccept(Socket s) | Subclasses of ServerSocket use this method to override accept() to return their own subclass of the socket. | 
| isBound() | Returns the binding state of the ServerSocket. | 
| isClosed() | Returns the closed state of the ServerSocket. | 
| setPerformancePreferences(int connectionTime, int latency, int bandwidth) | Sets performance preferences for this ServerSocket | 
| Sets performance preferences for this ServerSocket | Sets a default proposed value for the SO_RCVBUF option for sockets accepted from this ServerSocket. | 
| setReuseAddress(boolean on) | Enable/disable the SO_REUSEADDR socket option. | 
| setSocketFactory(SocketImplFactory fac) | Sets the server socket implementation factory for the application. | 
| setSoTimeout(int timeout) | Enable/disable SO_TIMEOUT with the specified timeout, in milliseconds. | 
| toString() | Returns the implementation address and implementation port of this socket as a String. |
