# java.time.LocalTime Class in Java

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/java-time-localtime-class-in-java/

The LocalTime class, available in the java.time package, represents a time without date and timezone. Introduced in Java 8, it is part of the modern Date-Time API and is used to store and manipulate time values such as meeting schedules, alarms, business hours, and event timings.
- Represents only hour, minute, second, and nanosecond.
- Provides methods for formatting, parsing, and comparing time values.
- Immutable and thread-safe.
Declaration
public final class LocalTime
   extends Object
    implements Temporal, TemporalAdjuster,
       Comparable<LocalTime>, Serializable

Approach
- Import the java.time.LocalTime class.
- Create a LocalTime object using methods such as now(), of(), or parse().
- Perform operations like formatting, comparison, addition, or subtraction.
- Display the result using System.out.println().
Example: Program to illustrate LocalTime Class
// Importing LocalDateTime class from 
// java.time package 
import java.time.LocalTime;
// Main Class
public class  GFG {
  
    // Main driver method 
    public static void main(String args[]) {
      
      // Creating an object of LocalTime class by
      // declaring a variable to store LocalTime 
        LocalTime ltime = LocalTime.now();
      
      // Print and display the LocalTime value
        System.out.println("Local time value : "+ltime);        
    }
}
Output
Local time value : 06:20:52.986897
Explanation: The LocalTime.now() method returns the current system time. The program creates a LocalTime object and prints the current time, including hours, minutes, seconds, and nanoseconds.
Example: Program to illustrate LocalTime where plusMethod() is illustrated
// Importing LocalTime class from
// java.time package 
import java.time.LocalTime;
// Main Class 
public class GFG {
  
    // main driver method 
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        // Creating an object of LocalTime Class by 
        // declaring a variable to store LocalTime
        LocalTime ltime = LocalTime.now();
        
      // Now plusMinute() will add up minutes to the LocalTime
        LocalTime time3 = ltime.plusMinutes(120);
        
        // Display the time using object of class
        System.out.println("Time : "+time3);
    }
}
Output
Time : 08:34:59.135137
Explanation: The plusMinutes(120) method adds 120 minutes (2 hours) to the current time and returns a new LocalTime object. The original time remains unchanged because LocalTime is immutable.
Example: Program to illustrate LocalTime where plusMethod() is illustrated
// Importing LocalTime class from
// java.time package 
import java.time.LocalTime;
// Main Class
public class GFG {
  
   // Main class
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        // Creating an object of LocalTime class by
        // declare a variable to store LocalTime
        LocalTime ltime = LocalTime.now();
      
        // plusHours() method will add up Hours to
        // the LocalTime
        LocalTime time3 = ltime.plusHours(05);
        
        // Display the time
        System.out.println(time3);
    }
}
Output
17:48:53.003478
Explanation: The plusHours(5) method adds 5 hours to the current time and returns a new LocalTime object. Since LocalTime is immutable, the original time is not modified.
