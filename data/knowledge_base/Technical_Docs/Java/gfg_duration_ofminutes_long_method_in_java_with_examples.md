# Duration ofMinutes(long) method in Java with Examples

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/duration-ofminuteslong-method-in-java-with-examples/

The ofMinutes(long) method of the Duration class in the java.time package is used to create a Duration object representing the specified number of minutes. Internally, the duration is stored in seconds and nanoseconds, where 1 minute = 60 seconds.
- Creates a Duration representing the specified number of minutes.
- Accepts both positive and negative minute values.
- Commonly used for representing time intervals in scheduling, delays, and timeout operations
import java.time.Duration;
public class Geeks {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a duration of 10 minutes
        Duration duration = Duration.ofMinutes(10);
        System.out.println("Minutes : " + duration.toMinutes());
        System.out.println("Seconds : " + duration.getSeconds());
    }
}
Output
Minutes : 10
Seconds : 600
Explanation: The ofMinutes(10) method creates a duration of 10 minutes. The toMinutes() method returns the duration in minutes, while getSeconds() returns the equivalent duration in seconds (600 seconds).
Syntax
public static Duration ofMinutes(long minutes)
- Parameters-> minutes: The number of minutes to represent. It can be positive, zero, or negative.
- Return Value: Returns a Duration representing the specified number of minutes.
- Exception: Throws ArithmeticException if the specified value exceeds the supported range of Duration.
Example: Creating a Positive Duration
import java.time.Duration;
public class GFG {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // input number of Minutes
        long noOfMinutes = 5;
        // Duration using ofMinutes() method
        Duration duration
            = Duration.ofMinutes(noOfMinutes);
        System.out.println(duration.getSeconds());
    }
}
Output
300
Explanation: The ofMinutes(5) method creates a duration of 5 minutes, which is equivalent to 300 seconds.
Example: Creating a Negative Duration
import java.time.Duration;
public class Geeks {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a negative duration
        Duration duration = Duration.ofMinutes(-15);
        System.out.println(duration.getSeconds());
    }
}
Output
-900
Explanation: The ofMinutes(-15) method creates a duration representing -15 minutes, which is equal to -900 seconds.
Common Methods Used with Duration
| Method | Description | 
|---|---|
| getSeconds() | Returns the duration in seconds. | 
| toMinutes() | Returns the total duration in minutes. | 
| toHours() | Returns the total duration in hours. | 
| plus(Duration) | Adds another duration. | 
| minus(Duration) | Subtracts another duration. | 
| isNegative() | Checks whether the duration is negative. | 
| isZero() | Checks whether the duration is zero. | 
Advantages of ofMinutes(long) Method
- Creates a Duration directly from minute values.
- Supports positive, negative, and zero durations.
- Improves readability compared to manually converting minutes into seconds.
- Useful for scheduling, delays, timeout values, and time interval calculations.
