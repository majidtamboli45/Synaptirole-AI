# How to Use Locks in Multi

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/how-to-use-locks-in-multi-threaded-java-program/

In Java, a lock is a synchronization mechanism that ensures mutual exclusion for critical sections in a multi-threaded program. It controls access to shared resources, ensuring thread safety. Some locks, like
- Exclusive Lock(ReentrantLock): Only one thread can acquire the lock at a time.
- Shared Lock(ReadWriteLock): Multiple threads can hold the lock simultaneously under certain conditions.
Basic usage of a Lock:
Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
lock.lock();   // Acquire the lock
// Critical section
lock.unlock(); // Release the lock
Types of Locks in Java
1. ReentrantLock
A ReentrantLock() is an implementation of Lock that allows a thread to reacquire the lock it already holds.
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;
class Worker implements Runnable {
    private ReentrantLock lock;
    private String name;
    Worker(ReentrantLock lock, String name)
    {
        this.lock = lock;
        this.name = name;
    }
    @Override public void run()
    {
        lock.lock(); // Acquire lock
        try {
            System.out.println(name + " acquired lock");
            Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulate work
            System.out.println(name + " finished work");
        }
        catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        finally {
            lock.unlock(); // Release lock
        }
    }
}
public class GFG{
    
    public static void main(String[] args){
        
        ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
        Thread t1
            = new Thread(new Worker(lock, "Thread-1"));
        Thread t2
            = new Thread(new Worker(lock, "Thread-2"));
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
Output:
Thread-1 acquired lock
Thread-1 finished work
Thread-2 acquired lock
Thread-2 finished work
Explanation: Although both threads start together, one acquires the lock first while the other waits. After the lock is released, the waiting thread acquires it and proceeds.
2. ReadWriteLock
A ReadWriteLock allows multiple threads to read a resource concurrently, but only one thread to write, ensuring no reads happen during writing.
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReadWriteLock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock;
class SharedData{
    private final List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
    private final ReadWriteLock rwLock
        = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
    private final Lock readLock = rwLock.readLock();
    private final Lock writeLock = rwLock.writeLock();
    // Writer
    public void add(String value)
    {
        writeLock.lock();
        try {
            list.add(value);
            System.out.println(
                Thread.currentThread().getName()
                + " added: " + value);
        }
        finally {
            writeLock.unlock();
        }
    }
    // Reader
    public void read(int index)
    {
        readLock.lock();
        try {
            if (index < list.size()) {
                System.out.println(
                    Thread.currentThread().getName()
                    + " read: " + list.get(index));
            }
        }
        finally {
            readLock.unlock();
        }
    }
}
public class GFG{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        SharedData data = new SharedData();
        // Writers
        Thread writer1
            = new Thread(() -> data.add("Hi"), "Geek-1");
        Thread writer2 = new Thread(
            () -> data.add("Hello"), "Geek-2");
        // Readers
        Thread reader1
            = new Thread(() -> data.read(0), "Geek-1");
        Thread reader2
            = new Thread(() -> data.read(1), "Geek-2");
        writer1.start();
        writer2.start();
        reader1.start();
        reader2.start();
    }
}
Output
Geek-1 added: Hi
Geek-2 added: Hello
Geek-1 read: Hi
Geek-2 read: Hello
Explanation: ReadWriteLock allows multiple threads to read simultaneously but only one thread to write at a time. This ensures safe and efficient access to shared data.
Methods in the Lock Interface
The Lock interface provides several methods for acquiring and releasing locks:
| Method | Description | 
|---|---|
| void lock() | Acquires the lock if available; blocks if the lock is held by another thread. | 
| void lockInterruptibly() | Acquires the lock unless the thread is interrupted while waiting. | 
| void unlock() | Releases the lock. | 
| Condition newCondition() | Returns a Condition object associated with the lock. Useful for wait/notify. | 
| boolean tryLock() | Attempts to acquire the lock immediately, returning true if successful. | 
| boolean tryLock(long time, TimeUnit unit) | Tries to acquire the lock within a specified timeout. Returns true if successful. |
