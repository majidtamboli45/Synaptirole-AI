# Java Variables

In Java, variables are containers used to store data in memory. Variables define how data is stored, accessed, and manipulated. A variable in Java has three components,
- Data Type: Defines the kind of data stored (e.g., int, String, float).
- Variable Name: A unique identifier following Java naming rules.
- Value: The actual data assigned to the variable.
class Geeks {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // Declaring and initializing variables
        
        // Integer variable  
        int age = 25;       
        
        // String variable  
        String name = "GeeksforGeeks"; 
        
        // Double variable 
        double salary = 50000.50;     
        // Displaying the values of variables
        System.out.println("Age: " + age);          
        System.out.println("Name: " + name);        
        System.out.println("Salary: " + salary);
    }
}
Output
Age: 25
Name: GeeksforGeeks
Salary: 50000.5
Declaration
The image below demonstrates how we can declare a variable in Java:
From the image, it can be easily perceived that while declaring a variable, we need to take care of two things that are data type of the variable and name.
Initialization
It can be perceived with the help of 3 components explained above:
Example: Here, we are initializing variables of different types like float, int and char.
class Geeks{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Declaring and initializing variables
        
        // Initializing float variable
        float si = 5.5f; 
        
        // Initializing integer variables
        int t = 10; 
        int s = 20; 
        
        // Initializing character variable
        char var = 'h';               
        // Displaying the values of the variables
        System.out.println("Simple Interest: " + si);  
        System.out.println("Speed: " + s);                      
        System.out.println("Time: " + t);                        
        System.out.println("Character: " + var);                
    }
}
Output
Simple Interest: 5.5
Speed: 20
Time: 10
Character: h
Naming Rule 's of Java Variables
- Start with a Letter, $, or _ – Variable names must begin with a letter (a–z, A–Z), dollar sign $, or underscore _.
- No Keywords: Reserved Java keywords (e.g., int, class, if) cannot be used as variable names.
- Case Sensitive: age and Age are treated as different variables.
- Use Letters, Digits, $, or _ : After the first character, you can use letters, digits (0–9), $, or _.
- Meaningful Names: Choose descriptive names that reflect the purpose of the variable (e.g., studentName instead of s).
- No Spaces: Variable names cannot contain spaces.
- Follow Naming Conventions: Typically, use camelCase for variable names in Java (e.g., totalMarks).
