# Main thread in Java

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/main-thread-java/

When a Java program starts, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) creates a thread automatically called the main thread. This thread executes the main() method and controls the overall execution flow of the program.
- It is the parent thread from which all other user-defined threads are created.
- The default name of the main thread is "main".
- The default priority of the main thread is 5.
- It usually finishes last as it may perform cleanup and shutdown tasks.
Create the Main Thread
The main thread is created automatically when the program starts. To control it, we must first obtain a reference to it using Thread.currentThread(). This method returns a reference to the currently executing thread.
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
// Class 1
// Main class extending thread class
public class Test extends Thread {
    // Main driver method
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Getting reference to Main thread
        Thread t = Thread.currentThread();
        // Getting name of Main thread
        System.out.println("Current thread: "
                           + t.getName());
        // Changing the name of Main thread
        t.setName("Geeks");
        System.out.println("After name change: "
                           + t.getName());
        // Getting priority of Main thread
        System.out.println("Main thread priority: "
                           + t.getPriority());
        // Setting priority of Main thread to MAX(10)
        t.setPriority(MAX_PRIORITY);
        // Print and display the main thread priority
        System.out.println("Main thread new priority: "
                           + t.getPriority());
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Main thread");
        }
        // Main thread creating a child thread
        Thread ct = new Thread() {
            // run() method of a thread
            public void run()
            {
                for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                    System.out.println("Child thread");
                }
            }
        };
        // Getting priority of child thread
        // which will be inherited from Main thread
        // as it is created by Main thread
        System.out.println("Child thread priority: "
                           + ct.getPriority());
        // Setting priority of Main thread to MIN(1)
        ct.setPriority(MIN_PRIORITY);
        System.out.println("Child thread new priority: "
                           + ct.getPriority());
        // Starting child thread
        ct.start();
    }
}
// Class 2
// Helper class extending Thread class
// Child Thread class
class ChildThread extends Thread {
    @Override public void run()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            // Print statement whenever child thread is
            // called
            System.out.println("Child thread");
        }
    }
}
Output
Current thread: main
After name change: Geeks
Main thread priority: 5
Main thread new priority: 10
Main thread
Main thread
Main thread
Main thread

Child thread priority: 10
Child thread new priority: 1

Explanation:
- Thread.currentThread() returns the main thread.
- getName() and setName() allow reading and changing the thread name.
- getPriority() and setPriority() allow reading and changing the thread priority.
- The main thread can create child threads, which by default inherit the main thread’s priority.
Relationship Between main() Method and Main Thread
- For every Java program, JVM creates the main thread first.
- The main thread checks for the existence of the main() method, then initializes the class.
- Since JDK 6, the main() method is mandatory for a standalone Java application.
Deadlock Using Main Thread
Even a single main thread can cause deadlock if it waits for itself.
public class GFG {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Try block to check for exceptions
    try {
      // Print statement
      System.out.println("Entering into Deadlock");
      // Joining the current thread
      Thread.currentThread().join();
      // This statement will never execute
      System.out.println("This statement will never execute");
    }
    // Catch block to handle the exceptions
    catch (InterruptedException e) {
      // Display the exception along with line number
      // using printStackTrace() method
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}
Output:
Explanation:
- Thread.currentThread().join() tells the main thread to wait for itself to die.
- The thread waits indefinitely, causing a deadlock.
- Any code after join() will never execute.
