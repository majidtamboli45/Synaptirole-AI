# Java Exception Handling

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/exceptions-in-java/

Exception handling in Java is a mechanism used to handle exceptional conditions that occur during program execution. It helps prevent the program from terminating unexpectedly and allows developers to provide appropriate recovery or error-handling logic.
- Separates error-handling code from normal program logic.
- Helps maintain the normal flow of program execution.
- Supports handling of both checked and unchecked exceptions.
Java Exception Hierarchy
In Java, all exceptions and errors are subclasses of the Throwable class. It has two main branches
- Exception.
- Error
Types of Java Exceptions
Java defines several types of exceptions that relate to its various class libraries. Java also allows users to define their it's exceptions.
1. Built-in Exception
Built-in Exception are pre-defined exception classes provided by Java to handle common errors during program execution. There are two type of built-in exception in java.
- Checked Exception: These exceptions are checked at compile time, forcing the programmer to handle them explicitly.
- Unchecked Exception: These exceptions are checked at runtime and do not require explicit handling at compile time.

2. User-Defined Exception
Sometimes, the built-in exceptions in Java are not able to describe a certain situation. In such cases, users can also create exceptions, which are called "user-defined Exceptions".
Basic try-catch
- The try block contains code that might throw an exception,
- The catch block handles the exception if it occurs.
class Geeks{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        int n = 10;
        int m = 0;
        try {
            int ans = n / m;
            System.out.println("Answer: " + ans);
        } catch (ArithmeticException e){
            System.out.println("Error: Division by 0!");
        } 
    }
}
Output
Error: Division by 0!
Explanation: The division operation throws an ArithmeticException. The matching catch block catches the exception and prints an appropriate message instead of allowing the program to terminate abruptly.
Finally Block
The finally block is used to execute cleanup code after try and catch. It normally executes whether an exception occurs or not. Finally may not execute in cases like:
- System.exit()
- JVM crash
- infinite loop before finally
class FinallyExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};
        try {
            System.out.println(numbers[5]);
        } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
            System.out.println("Exception caught.");
        } finally {
            System.out.println("Finally block executed.");
        }
        System.out.println("Program continues...");
    }
}
Output
Exception caught.
Finally block executed.
Program continues...
throw and throws Keywords
throw: Used to explicitly throw a single exception.
Syntax:
throw new ExceptionType("message");
class Demo {
    static void checkAge(int age) {
        
        if (age < 18) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Age must be 18 or above");
        }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        checkAge(15);
    }
}
Output:
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Age must be 18 or above at Demo.checkAge(Demo.java:5) at Demo.main(Demo.java:11)
 throws: The throws keyword is used in a method declaration to indicate that the method may throw one or more exceptions.
Syntax:
returnType methodName() throws ExceptionType {
// Code
}
import java.io.*;
class Demo {
    // Method declares that it may throw IOException
    static void readFile(String fileName) throws IOException {
        // Using try-with-resources to automatically close FileReader
        try (FileReader file = new FileReader(fileName)) {
            int data;
            while ((data = file.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) data); // Read and print file content
            }
        }
        // No need for finally block to close the resource
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            readFile("test.txt"); // Attempt to read file
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("File not found or error reading file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
        System.out.println("\nProgram continues after file operation.");
    }
}
Output
File not found or error reading file: test.txt (No such file or directory)
Program continues after file operation.
Internal Working of try-catch Block:
- JVM executes code inside the try block.
- If an exception occurs, remaining try code is skipped and JVM searches for a matchingcatch block.
- If found, the catch block executes.
- Control then moves to the finally block (if present).
- If no matching catch is found, the exception is handled by JVM’s default handler.
- The finally block always executes, whether an exception occurs or not.
Note: When an exception occurs and is not handled, the program terminates abruptly and the code after it, will never execute.
Nested try-catch
In Java, you can place one try-catch block inside another to handle exceptions at multiple levels.
public class NestedTryExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            System.out.println("Outer try block");
            try {
                int a = 10 / 0; // This causes ArithmeticException
            } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
                System.out.println("Inner catch: " + e);
            }
            String str = null;
            System.out.println(str.length()); // This causes NullPointerException
        } catch (NullPointerException e) {
            System.out.println("Outer catch: " + e);
        }
    }
}
Output
Outer try block
Inner catch: java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
Outer catch: java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "String.length()" because "<local1>" is null
Explanation: The inner try-catch handles the ArithmeticException. Later, the outer try encounters a NullPointerException, which is handled by the outer catch.
Handling Multiple Exception
We can handle multiple type of exceptions in Java by using multiple catch blocks, each catching a different type of exception.
try {
    
    // Code that may throw an exception
    
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    
    // Code to handle the exception
    
} catch(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e){
    
    // Code to handle the another exception
    
}catch(NumberFormatException e){
    
     // Code to handle the another exception
}
Methods to Print the Exception Information
- printStackTrace(): Prints the full stack trace of the exception, including the name, message and location of the error.
- toString(): Prints exception information in the format of the Name of the exception.
- getMessage() : Prints the description of the exception
How Does JVM Handle an Exception?
When an Exception occurs, the JVM creates an exception object containing the error name, description, and program state. Throwing an exception means creating an exception object and transferring control to the nearest appropriate exception handler using the throw keyword. There might be a list of the methods that had been called to get to the method where an exception occurred. This ordered list of methods is called call stack. Now the following procedure will happen:
- The run-time system searches the call stack for an exception handler
- It starts searching from the method where the exception occurred and proceeds backward through the call stack.
- If a handler is found, the exception is passed to it.
- If no handler is found, the default exception handler terminates the program and prints the stack trace.
Exception in thread "abc" Name of Exception : Description
  // Call Stack
Illustration:
class Geeks{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        // Taking an empty string
        String s = null;
      
        // Getting length of a string
        System.out.println(s.length());
    }
}
Output:
Exception Vs Error
| Feature | Exception | Error | 
|---|---|---|
| Definition | An event that occurs during program execution, disrupting normal flow, which can be handled using try-catch. | A serious problem that occurs in the JVM, generally cannot be handled by the application. | 
| Package | java.lang.Exception | java.lang.Error | 
| Recoverable | Yes, can be caught and handled. | No, usually not recoverable. | 
| Examples | IOException, SQLException, ArithmeticException | OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError |
