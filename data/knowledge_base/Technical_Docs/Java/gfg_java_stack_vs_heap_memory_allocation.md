# Java Stack vs Heap Memory Allocation

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/java-stack-vs-heap-memory-allocation/

In Java, memory allocation is primarily divided into two categories, i.e., Stack and Heap memory. Both are used for different purposes, and they have different characteristics.
- Stack Memory: Stores primitive local variables, method call information, and references to objects during program execution.
- Heap Memory: Stores actual objects and dynamic data allocated at runtime. Objects created with new are placed here, and this memory is managed by the Garbage Collector.
class Employee {
    int id;        // Primitive stored inside the object in Heap
    String name;   // Reference points to String object in Heap
    double salary; // Primitive stored inside the object in Heap
    public Employee(int id, String name, double salary) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.salary = salary;
    }
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Employee ID: " + id);
        System.out.println("Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Salary: " + salary);
    }
}
public class Main {
    // Reference variable 'emp' stored in Stack
    public static void display(Employee emp) {
        emp.display(); // Accesses Employee object in Heap
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // 'emp1' and 'emp2' references in Stack, objects in Heap
        Employee emp1 = new Employee(101, "Maddy", 50000.0);
        Employee emp2 = new Employee(102, "Maddy", 60000.0);
        display(emp1);
        display(emp2);
    }
}
Output
Employee ID: 101
Name: Maddy
Salary: 50000.0
Employee ID: 102
Name: Maddy
Salary: 60000.0
Memory representation for the above example:
- emp1 and emp2: references stored on stack.
- new Employee(...): objects stored in heap.
- "Maddy"; stored once in String Pool (heap).
- Both emp1.name and emp2.name: point to the same string object.
- display(emp1): creates a stack frame, parameter e points to emp1.
- (emp1.name == emp2.name): true since both refer to the same pooled string.
Stack Memory Allocation
Stack memory is used for method calls, local variables, and references. Memory is automatically allocated when a method starts and cleared when it ends. Data exists only during the method’s execution. If the stack runs out of space, a StackOverflowError occurs.
class Geeks {
    public static int add(int a, int b) { 
        int res = a + b;  // local variable in stack
        return res;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 10;   // stored in stack
        int b = 20;   // stored in stack
        int sum = add(a, b);
        System.out.println("The sum is: " + sum);
    }
}
Output
The sum is: 30
Heap Memory Allocation
Heap memory is used for objects and instance variables created using the new keyword. The size depends on the class structure. The Garbage Collector manages this area by removing unused objects.
Heap Memory Regions:
- Young Generation: Stores newly created objects.
- Survivor Space: Holds objects that survive garbage collection from Eden space.
- Old Generation: Stores long-lived objects.
Non-Heap Memory Areas:
- Metaspace (earlier Permanent Generation): Stores class metadata and uses native memory (introduced in Java 8).
- Code Cache: Stores JIT-compiled and optimized native code.
Example: Object in heap
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
Here, the Scanner object is in the heap, while the reference sc is in the stack.
Note: Garbage collection in the heap ensures automatic memory management.
Difference Between Stack and Heap Memory in Java
| Stack | Heap | 
|---|---|
| Memory is allocated in a contiguous block. | Memory is allocated in any random order. | 
| Allocation and deallocation are automatic (handled by compiler). | Allocation and deallocation are automatic (handled by the Garbage Collector). | 
| It is less costly | It is more costly | 
| Its implementation is easy | Its implementation is hard | 
| Access time is faster | Access time is slower | 
| Limited memory size may lead to shortage issues. | Can suffer from memory fragmentation due to dynamic allocation. | 
| Stack provides excellent memory locality | Heap is adequate but not as efficient | 
| Thread safe, data stored can only be accessed by the owner | Not thread safe, data stored is visible to all threads | 
| Stack is fixed in size | Heap allows resizing as needed | 
| Stack uses a linear data structure | Heap uses a hierarchical data structure | 
| Static memory allocation is preferred in an array. | Heap memory allocation is preferred in the linked list. | 
| Smaller than heap memory. | Larger than stack memory. |
