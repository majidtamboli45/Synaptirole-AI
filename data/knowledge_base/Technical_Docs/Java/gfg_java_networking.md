Java Networking is the concept of connecting two or more computing devices to exchange data and resources. It allows Java applications to communicate over the internet or local networks.
- All communications in Java networking happen at the application layer.
- The java.net package provides APIs for protocols, sockets, IP addresses, and URLs.
- Java was designed with networking in mind, making distributed computing simpler.
- In Java, networking is supported through the java.net package, which provides classes and interfaces to handle low-level communication, socket programming, and access to network resources.
Common Network Protocols
1. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures data is delivered accurately and in the correct order. It establishes a connection before communication and verifies successful data transfer.
- Reliable and error-checked data transmission
- Maintains data order using acknowledgements
- Used for web applications, file transfer, and emails
2. UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
UDP is a connectionless protocol designed for fast data transmission without delivery guarantees. It sends data packets independently, making it suitable for real-time communication.
- Faster but unreliable compared to TCP
- No connection setup or acknowledgement
- Used in streaming, gaming, and video conferencing

Java Networking Terminology
- IP Address: Logical address that identifies a device on a network (e.g., 192.168.0.1). Range: 0.0.0.0 – 255.255.255.255.
- Port Number: Identifies applications uniquely on a device. Range: 0 – 65,535.
- Protocol: Set of rules for communication (e.g., TCP, FTP, HTTP).
- MAC Address: Unique identifier assigned to a network interface card, written in hexadecimal.
- Socket: Endpoint for two-way communication between devices.
- Connection-Oriented Protocol: Requires connection setup (e.g., TCP).
- Connectionless Protocol: No prior connection setup, data sent directly (e.g., UDP).
Java Networking classes
The java.net package provides classes to handle networking operations in Java. Commonly used classes are:
- CacheRequest: Used to store resources in ResponseCache. Provides an OutputStream to write resource data into cache.
- CookieHandler: Provides a callback mechanism to manage HTTP cookies during client-server communication.
- CookieManager: A concrete implementation of CookieHandler that manages cookies using CookieStore and CookiePolicy.
- DatagramPacket: Represents a data packet used in UDP-based, connectionless communication.
- InetAddress: Represents IP addresses and hostnames, supporting both IPv4 and IPv6.
- ServerSocket: Implements the server side of a TCP connection and listens for client requests on a port.
- Socket: Represents a client-side TCP connection used to send and receive data.
- DatagramSocket: Used for sending and receiving UDP packets and supports broadcast communication.
- Proxy: Represents proxy settings for a connection. Useful for network security and anonymity.
- URL: Represents a Uniform Resource Locator pointing to a web resource such as a file or web page.
- URLConnection: Represents a communication link between a Java application and a URL resource.
- HttpURLConnection: A subclass of URLConnection that supports HTTP-specific operations like GET and POST.
- URLEncoder / URLDecoder: Encode and decode strings to make them safe for transmission in URLs.
- MulticastSocket: A specialized UDP socket used for group communication (multicasting).
- Authenticator: Provides a mechanism to handle authentication when accessing protected network resources.
Java Networking Interfaces
Important interfaces from java.net:
- CookiePolicy: Defines rules for accepting or rejecting HTTP cookies.
- CookieStore: Stores and manages cookies used during HTTP communication.
- FileNameMap: Maps file names or extensions to corresponding MIME types.
- SocketOption: Used to configure socket behavior such as timeout and buffer size.
- SocketImplFactory: Allows creation of custom socket implementation classes.
- ProtocolFamily: Represents a family of communication protocols.
Socket Programming
Socket programming enables communication between client and server applications over TCP or UDP.
Steps for TCP Communication
- Server creates a ServerSocket and listens on a port.
- Client creates a Socket and requests a connection.
- Server accepts the connection and returns a Socket.
- Data is exchanged via I/O streams (InputStream, OutputStream).
- Connection is closed when communication ends.
Socket Class
The Socket class represents a TCP client-side connection. It allows sending, receiving data, and closing connections. Each socket is associated with one remote host, for another host a new socket must be created.
Common Methods:
- connect(SocketAddress host, int timeout): Connects the socket to a given host.
- getPort(): Returns the remote port of the connection.
- getInetAddress(): Returns the remote IP address.
- getLocalPort(): Returns the local port of the socket.
- getRemoteSocketAddress(): Returns the remote socket address.
- getInputStream(): Returns input stream of the socket.
- getOutputStream(): Returns output stream of the socket.
- close(): Closes the socket connection.
ServerSocket Class
The ServerSocket class implements the server side of a TCP connection. It listens for client requests on a given port. If the port is unavailable, the constructor throws an exception.
Common Methods:
- getLocalPort(): Returns the port the server is listening on.
- setSoTimeout(int timeout): Sets timeout while waiting for a client.
- accept(): Waits and accepts a client connection.
- bind(SocketAddress host, int backlog): Binds server to a specific address and port.
Example: Basic Client-Server Communication
Client Side
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;
public class ClientSide {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (Socket socket = new Socket("127.0.0.1", 5000);
             DataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());
             BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in))) {
            
            System.out.println("Connected to Server");
            String line;
            while (!(line = br.readLine()).equals("End")) {
                out.writeUTF(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
Server Side
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;
public class ServerSide {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (ServerSocket server = new ServerSocket(5000);
             Socket socket = server.accept();
             DataInputStream in = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream())) {
            
            System.out.println("Server started. Waiting for client...");
            String line;
            while (!(line = in.readUTF()).equals("End")) {
                System.out.println("Client: " + line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
Execution Steps
- Run ServerSide. It waits for a client.
- Run ClientSide. It connects to the server.
- Type messages in the client window, server displays them.
InetAddress Class
The InetAddress class represents IP addresses and hostnames. It supports both IPv4 and IPv6.
Types of Addresses
- Unicast: Identifies a single interface.
- Multicast: Identifies a group of interfaces.
Common Methods:
- getByAddress(byte[] addr): Returns an InetAddress from raw IP.
- getByName(String host): Returns IP of a given hostname.
- getLocalHost(): Returns local host IP.
- getHostName(): Returns hostname.
- getHostAddress(): Returns IP address as string.
Example:
import java.net.*;
public class InetAddressExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        InetAddress local = InetAddress.getLocalHost();
        System.out.println("Local Host: " + local);
        System.out.println("Host Name: " + local.getHostName());
        InetAddress gfg = InetAddress.getByName("www.geeksforgeeks.org");
        System.out.println("GeeksforGeeks IP: " + gfg);
    }
}
URL Class
The URL class represents a Uniform Resource Locator that points to a resource on the web.
Components of a URL
- Protocol: How communication happens (http, https, ftp).
- Hostname: The server where the resource exists.
- File/Path: The location of the resource.
- Port (optional): Communication port number.
Common Methods:
- getProtocol(): Returns protocol of URL.
- getHost(): Returns hostname.
- getPort(): Returns port of the URL.
- getFile(): Returns filename.
- getPath(): Returns path of the URL.
- toString(): Returns URL as a string.
- getDefaultPort(): Returns default port of the protocol.
Example:
import java.net.*;
public class URLExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        URL url = new URL("https://write.geeksforgeeks.org/post/3038131");
        System.out.println("Protocol : " + url.getProtocol());
        System.out.println("Host : " + url.getHost());
        System.out.println("File : " + url.getFile());
        System.out.println("Path : " + url.getPath());
        System.out.println("Default Port : " + url.getDefaultPort());
    }
}
Output:
Protocol : https  
Host : write.geeksforgeeks.org 
File : /post/3038131  
Path : /post/3038131
Default Port : 443
