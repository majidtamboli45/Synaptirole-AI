# Java Thread.start() vs Thread.run() Method

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/difference-between-thread-start-and-thread-run-in-java/

In Java's multithreading concept, start() and run() are the two important methods of the Thread class. Although they might seem similar, they behave very differently. This article explains the differences and shows how to use them effectively.
Thread.start() Method
The start() method is used to begin a new thread of execution. It performs two main tasks:
- Allocates resources for a new thread.
- Calls the run() method internally in the new thread.
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run(){
        System.out.println("Thread running using start()");
    }
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        
        // Starts a new thread
        t1.start(); 
    }
}
Output
Thread running using start()
Explanation: Calling start() creates a new thread. run() is executed in the context of that new thread.
Thread.run() Method
The run() method contains the code executed by the thread. However, calling run() directly does not create a new thread. Instead, it behaves like a normal method call executed in the current thread.
class MyThread extends Thread{
    
    public void run(){
        
        System.out.println("Thread running using run()");
    }
    public static void main(String[] args){
        
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        
        // Does NOT start a new thread
        t1.run(); 
    }
}
Output
Thread running using run()
Explanation: Here, run() is executed in the main thread, so no multithreading occurs.
Multiple Invocations
In Java's Multi-Threading Concept, another most important difference between start() and run() method is that we can't call the start() method twice otherwise it will throw an IllegalThreadStateException whereas run() method can be called multiple times as it is just a normal method calling.
Example 1: Multiple invocation of start() method.
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run(){
        System.out.println(
            "Current thread: "
            + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}
public class Geeks{
    
    public static void main(String[] args){
        
        MyThread t = new MyThread();
        t.start();
        t.start(); // Throws exception
    }
}
Output:
Current thread: Thread-0
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalThreadStateException
Example 2: Multiple invocation of run() method
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run(){
        
        System.out.println(
            "Current thread: "
            + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}
public class Geeks{
    
    public static void main(String[] args){
        
        MyThread t = new MyThread();
        t.run();
        t.run(); // Works fine
    }
}
Output
Current thread: main
Current thread: main
Explanation: As we can see in the above example, calling run() method twice doesn't raise any exception and it is executed twice as expected but on the main thread itself.
Thread.start() vs Thread.run() Method
| Feature | start() Method | run() Method | 
|---|---|---|
| Thread Creation | Creates a new thread. | Does not create a new thread. | 
| Execution Context | Runs run() in a separate thread. | Runs run() in the current thread. | 
| Purpose | To start concurrent execution. | To define the code that a thread will execute. | 
| Behavior | Allows true parallel execution. | Acts like a normal method call. | 
| Usage Example | t1.start(); | t1.run(); |
