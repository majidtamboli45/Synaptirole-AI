# java.time.LocalDate Class in Java

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/java-time-localdate-class-in-java/

The LocalDate class, available in the java.time package, represents a date without time and timezone. Introduced in Java 8, it is part of the modern Date-Time API and is commonly used to store and manipulate dates such as birthdays, holidays, and event dates.
- Does not store time or timezone information.
- Immutable and thread-safe.
- Supports date arithmetic such as adding or subtracting days, months, and years.
Syntax
public final class LocalDate
       extends Object
        implements Temporal,
           TemporalAdjuster,
                 ChronoLocalDate,
                      Serializable
Commonly Used Methods of LocalDate
| Methods | Description | 
|---|---|
| adjustInto(Temporal temporal) | This method adjusts the specified temporal object to having the same date as this object. | 
| atStartOfDay() | This method combines this date with the time of midnight to create a LocalDateTime at the start of this date. | 
| atStartOfDay(ZoneId zone) | This method returns a zoned date-time from this date at the earliest valid time according to the rules in the time-zone. | 
| atTime(int hour, int minute) | This method combines this date with a time to create a LocalDateTime. | 
| atTime(int hour, int minute, int second) | This method combines this date with a time to create a LocalDateTime. | 
| compareTo(ChronoLocalDate other) | This method compares this date to another date. | 
| equals(Object obj) | This method checks if this date is equal to another date. | 
| format(DateTimeFormatter formatter) | This method formats this date using the specified formatter. | 
| from(TemporalAccessor temporal) | This method obtains an instance of LocalDate from a temporal object. | 
| get(TemporalField field) | This method gets the value of the specified field from this date as an int. | 
| getChronology() | This method gets the chronology of this date, which is the ISO calendar system. | 
| getDayOfMonth() | This method gets the day-of-month field. | 
| getDayOfWeek() | This method gets the day-of-week field, which is an enum DayOfWeek. | 
| getDayOfYear() | This method gets the day-of-year field. | 
| getEra() | This method gets the era applicable at this date. | 
| getLong(TemporalField field) | This method gets the value of the specified field from this date as a long. | 
| getMonth() | This method gets the month-of-year field using the Month enum. | 
| getMonthValue() | This method gets the month-of-year field from 1 to 12. | 
| getYear() | This method gets the year field. | 
| hashCode() | A hash code for this date. | 
| isAfter(ChronoLocalDate other) | This method checks if this date is after the specified date. | 
| isBefore(ChronoLocalDate other) | This method checks if this date is before the specified date. | 
| isEqual(ChronoLocalDate other) | This method checks if this date is equal to the specified date. | 
| isLeapYear() | This method checks if the year is a leap year, according to the ISO proleptic calendar system rules. | 
| isSupported(TemporalField field) | This method checks if the specified field is supported. | 
| lengthOfMonth() | This method returns the length of the month represented by this date. | 
| lengthOfYear() | This method returns the length of the year represented by this date. | 
| now() | It is a method used to return the instance of LocalDateTime class. | 
| ofPattern() | It is a method used with DateTimeFormatter to format and parse date and time. It accepts all types or sorts of value, to display in a different format. | 
| query(TemporalQuery<R> query) | This method queries this date using the specified query. | 
| range(TemporalField field) | This method gets the range of valid values for the specified field. | 
| toEpochDay() | This method converts this date to Epoch Day. | 
| withDayOfMonth(int dayOfMonth) | This method returns a copy of this LocalDate with the day-of-month altered. | 
| withDayOfYear(int dayOfYear) | This method returns a copy of this LocalDate with the day-of-year altered. | 
| withMonth(int month) | This method returns a copy of this LocalDate with the month-of-year altered. | 
| withYear(int year) | This method returns a copy of this LocalDate with the year altered. | 
Approach
- Import the required classes from the java.time package.
- Create or obtain a LocalDate object using methods such as now(), of(), or parse().
- Perform operations such as formatting, comparison, or date modification using the available methods.
- Display the resulting date using System.out.println().
Below is the implementation of the problem statement:
Example 1: Display the Current Date
import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter;
public class Geeks {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Get the current date
        LocalDate date = LocalDate.now();
        // Format the date
        DateTimeFormatter formatter =
                DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("dd MMM yyyy");
        System.out.println("Current Date: "
                + date.format(formatter));
    }
}
Output
Current Date: 09 Jul 2026
Explanation: The LocalDate.now() method returns the current system date. The DateTimeFormatter formats the date into a more readable format before displaying it.
Example 2: Modify an Existing Date
import java.time.LocalDate;
public class Geeks {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LocalDate date = LocalDate.parse("2026-07-09");
        LocalDate updatedDate = date.withDayOfYear(1);
        System.out.println(updatedDate);
    }
}
Output
2026-01-01
Explanation: The withDayOfYear() method returns a new LocalDate with the specified day of the year while keeping the original object unchanged.
Advantages of LocalDate
- Represents dates without time and timezone.
- Immutable and thread-safe.
- Easy to create, compare, and manipulate dates.
- Supports parsing and formatting using DateTimeFormatter.
- Provides rich methods for date calculations.
- Replaces the legacy java.util.Date API with a cleaner design.
- Suitable for applications such as birthdays, anniversaries, and scheduling.
