# Java Class vs Interfaces

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/differences-between-interface-and-class-in-java/

In Java, classes and interfaces are used to define the structure and behavior of programs. While they might seem similar, since both can hold methods and variables, they have very different purposes.
A class can extend another class and implement an interface, while an interface can only extend another interface, not implement a class.
Class in Java
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It encapsulates fields (state) and methods (behavior) that are common to all objects of that type.
class Student{
    
    //data member (also instance variable) 
    int id; 
    
    //data member (also instance variable)  
    String name;
    public static void main(String args[]){
        
        //creating an object of Student
        Student s1=new Student();  
        System.out.println(s1.id);  
        System.out.println(s1.name);  
    }  
}
Output
0
null
Explanation: Above code defines a Student class with two instance variables, id and name, and creates an object to demonstrate default values. It shows that objects of a class can hold state and access its fields.
Interface in Java
An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class. Interface variables are implicitly public static final. Before Java 8, interface methods were implicitly public abstract. From Java 8 onward, interfaces can also contain default and static methods, and from Java 9 onward, private methods are allowed.
import java.io.*;
// Interface Declared
interface testInterface{
  
    // public, static and final
    final int a = 10;
    // public and abstract
    void display();
}
// Class implementing interface
class TestClass implements testInterface{
  
    // Implementing the capabilities of Interface
    public void display(){ 
      System.out.println("Geek"); 
    }
}
class Geeks{
    
    public static void main(String[] args){
        
        TestClass t = new TestClass();
        t.display();
        System.out.println(t.a);
    }
}
Output
Geek
10
Explanation: Above code defines an interface with a constant and an abstract method, then implements it in a class providing method behavior. It demonstrates how a class can adopt an interface and use its constants and methods.
Class vs Interface
The following table lists all the major differences between an interface and a class in Java.
| Features | Class | Interface | 
|---|---|---|
| Keyword | The keyword used to create a class is "class". | The keyword used to create an interface is "interface". | 
| Instantiation | A class can be instantiated, i.e., objects of a class can be created. | An interface cannot be instantiated directly, instead, it is implemented by a class or a struct. | 
| Inheritance | Classes do not support multiple inheritance. | Interface supports multiple inheritance. | 
| Inheritance Mechanism | A class can inherit another class using the keyword extends. | A class uses implements to adopt an interface, while an interface uses extends to inherit another interface. | 
| Constructors | It can contain constructors. | It cannot contain constructors. | 
| Methods | Methods in a class can be abstract, concrete, or both. | An interface contains abstract methods by default (before Java 8) or default/static methods (from Java 8 onward). | 
| Access Specifiers | Variables and methods in a class can be declared using any access specifier(public, private, default, protected). | Interface variables are public static final, and methods are public by default. | 
| Variables | Variables in a class can be static, final, or neither. | All variables are static and final. | 
| Purpose | A class is a blueprint for creating objects and encapsulates data and behaviour. | An interface specifies a contract for classes to implement by focusing on capabilities rather than implementation. |
