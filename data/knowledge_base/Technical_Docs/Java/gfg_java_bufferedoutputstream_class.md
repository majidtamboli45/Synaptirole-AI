# Java BufferedOutputStream Class

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/java-io-bufferedoutputstream-class-java/

In Java, the BufferedOutputStream class is used to write data to an output stream more efficiently. It adds a buffer to another output stream, reducing the number of I/O operations by temporarily storing data in memory before writing it to the destination (like a file).
It belongs to the java.io package and extends the FilterOutputStream class.
Class Declaration
public class BufferedOutputStream extends FilterOutputStream
- Improves I/O performance by using a buffer to reduce direct disk access.
- Data is written to the buffer, and only when the buffer is full (or flushed), it is sent to the underlying output stream.
- Typically used with FileOutputStream.
- Helps in writing byte data, such as images, text files, and binary data.
Constructors
- BufferedOutputStream(OutputStream out): Creates a buffered output stream with a default buffer size of 8192 bytes.
- BufferedOutputStream(OutputStream out, int size): Creates a buffered output stream with the specified buffer size.
Important Methods
| Method | Description | 
|---|---|
| void write(int b) | Writes a single byte to the output stream. | 
| void write(byte[] b, int off, int len) | Writes a portion of the byte array to the output stream. | 
| void flush() | Flushes the buffer and forces any buffered output bytes to be written. | 
| void close() | Closes the stream, flushing it first. | 
Example 1: Writing Data to File using BufferedOutputStream
import java.io.*;
public class BufferedOutputStreamExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String data = "BufferedOutputStream in Java Example";
        try {
            FileOutputStream fileOut = new FileOutputStream("output.txt");
            BufferedOutputStream bufferOut = new BufferedOutputStream(fileOut);
            byte[] bytes = data.getBytes();
            bufferOut.write(bytes);
            bufferOut.close();
            System.out.println("Data written successfully.");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
Output (content of output.txt):

Example 2: Using flush() Method
import java.io.*;
public class FlushExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            FileOutputStream fileOut = new FileOutputStream("flush.txt");
            BufferedOutputStream bufferOut = new BufferedOutputStream(fileOut);
            bufferOut.write("Hello".getBytes());
            bufferOut.flush();  // ensures data is written immediately
            bufferOut.close();
            System.out.println("Flush example completed.");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
Output (content of flush.txt):
Hello
Example 3: Writing Large Data Efficiently
import java.io.*;
public class LargeDataExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            FileOutputStream fileOut = new FileOutputStream("large.txt");
            BufferedOutputStream bufferOut = new BufferedOutputStream(fileOut, 8192); // custom buffer size
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                bufferOut.write(("Line " + i + "\n").getBytes());
            }
            bufferOut.close();
            System.out.println("Large data written successfully.");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
Output (content of large.txt, first few lines):
Line 0
Line 1
Line 2
...
Advantages
- Faster writing performance compared to unbuffered streams.
- Reduces the number of physical write operations.
- Allows writing large data efficiently.
