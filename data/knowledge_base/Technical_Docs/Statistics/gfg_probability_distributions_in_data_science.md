Understanding how data behaves is one of the first steps in data science. Before we dive into building models or running analysis, we need to understand how the values in our dataset are spread out and that’s where probability distributions come in.
Example:
If you roll a fair die, the chance of getting a 6 is 1 out of 6, or 16.67%. This is a basic example of a probability distribution a way to describe the likelihood of different outcomes.
When dealing with complex data like customer purchases, stock prices, or weather, probability distributions help answer:
- What is most likely to happen?
- What are rare or unusual outcomes?
- Are values close together or spread out?
This helps us make better predictions and understand uncertainty.
Why Are Probability Distributions Important?
- Explain how data behaves (clustered or spread)
- Form the basis of machine learning models
- Used in statistical tests (e.g., p-value)
- Help identify outliers and make predictions
Before this, we need to understand random variables, which assign numbers to outcomes of random events (e.g., rolling a die).
Key Components of Probability Distributions
Now that we understand random variables let's explore how we describe their probabilities using three key concepts:
1. Probability Mass Function (PMF): Used for discrete variables (e.g., number of products bought). It gives the probability of each exact value. For example, 25% of customers buy exactly 3 products.
2. Probability Density Function (PDF): Used for continuous variables (e.g., amount spent). It shows how probabilities spread over a range but not the chance of one exact value since values can be infinite.
3. Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF): Used for both types, it shows the probability that a value is less than or equal to a certain number. For example, CDF(3) = 0.75 means 75% buy 3 or fewer products; CDF($50) = 0.80 means 80% spend $50 or less. To find the CDF we can use the formula given below:
\text{CDF: } F_X(x) = P(X \leq x) = \int_{-\infty}^x f(t) \, dt 
Where F(x) is the CDF and f(t) is the PDF.
Types of Probability Distributions
Probability distributions can be divided into two main types based on the nature of the random variables: discrete and continuous.
Discrete Data Distributions
A discrete distribution is used when the random variable can take on countable, specific values. For example, when predicting the number of products a customer buys in a single order the possible outcomes are whole numbers like 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. You can't buy 2.5 products so this is a discrete random variable. It includes various distributions Let's understand them one by one:
1. Binomial Distribution
The binomial distribution calculates the chance of getting a certain number of successes in a fixed number of trials.
Formula (PMF):
P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} 
Where:
- n = number of trials
- k = number of successes
- p = probability of success
Example: flipping a coin 10 times and counting heads.
- Number of trials: 10
- Two outcomes per trial: heads (success) or tails (failure)
- Probability of success (heads): 0.5
- Shows likelihood of getting 0 to 10 heads
2. Bernoulli Distribution
The Bernoulli distribution describes experiments with only one trial and two possible outcomes: success or failure. It’s the simplest probability distribution.
Formula (PMF):
P(X = x) = p^x (1-p)^{1-x}, \quad x \in \{0,1\} 
Example: flipping a coin once and checking if it lands on heads.
- One trial only
- Two outcomes: heads (success) or tails (failure)
- Probability of success: 0.5
- Graph shows two bars representing success (1) and failure (0) with equal probabilities
3. Poisson Distribution
The Poisson distribution models the number of random events happening in a fixed time or area.
Formula (PMF):
P(X = k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!} 
Where:
- λ = average rate of occurrence
Example:
Counting how many customers enter a coffee shop per hour. It helps predict the probability of seeing a specific number of events based on the average rate.
- Counts events in a fixed interval
- Average rate (e.g., 5 customers/hour) is known
- Calculates probability of exact counts (e.g., exactly 3 customers)
- Graph shows a curve centered around the average rate, tapering off for less likely counts
4. Geometric Distributions
The geometric distribution models the number of trials needed to get the first success in repeated independent attempts.
Formula (PMF):
P(X = k) = (1-p)^{k-1} p 
Example
how many emails you must send before a customer makes a purchase. It helps predict the chance of success happening at each trial.
- Counts trials until first success
- Each trial is independent with fixed success probability
- Useful for questions like “How many emails until first purchase?”
- Graph shows a decreasing curve fewer trials are more likely
Continuous Data Distributions
A continuous distribution is used when the random variable can take any value within a specified range like when we analyze how much money a customer spends in a store then the amount can be any real number including decimals like $25.75, $50.23, etc.
In continuous distributions the Probability Density Function (PDF) shows how the probabilities are spread across the possible values. The area under the curve of this PDF represents the probability of the random variable falling within a certain range. Now let's look at some types of continuous probability distributions that are commonly used in data science:
1. Normal Distribution
The normal distribution, or bell curve, is one of the most common data distributions. Most values cluster around the mean, with fewer values farther away, forming a symmetrical shape. It’s perfect for modeling things like people’s heights.
- Mean is the center of the curve
- Symmetrical distribution (left and right sides mirror each other)
- Standard deviation shows how spread out the data is
- Smaller standard deviation means data is closer to the mean
PDF Formula:
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left(-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right) 
Where:
- μ = mean
- σ = standard deviation
2. Exponential Distribution
The exponential distribution models the time between events happening independently and continuously. For example, the time between customer arrivals at a store. It helps predict how long you might wait for the next event.
- Models waiting time between events
- Average time (e.g., 10 minutes between customers) defines the rate (λ)
- Events occur independently and continuously
- Useful for predicting time until next event
PDF Formula:
f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}, \quad x \ge 0 
While the exponential distribution focuses on waiting times sometimes we just need to model situations where every outcome is equally likely. In that case we use the uniform distribution.
3. Uniform Distribution
The uniform distribution means every outcome in a range is equally likely. For example, rolling a fair six-sided die or picking a random number between 0 and 1. It applies to both discrete and continuous cases.
- All outcomes have equal probability
- Discrete example: rolling a die (1 to 6)
- Continuous example: random number between 0 and 1
PDF Formula:
f(x) = \frac{1}{b-a}, \quad a \le x \le b 
4. Beta Distribution
In real-world problems, probabilities often change as we learn more. The Beta distribution helps model this uncertainty and update beliefs with new data. For example, it can estimate the chance a customer clicks an ad.
- Models changing probabilities between 0 and 1
- Parameters (α and β) control confidence and shape
- Commonly used in Bayesian stats and A/B testing
PDF Formula:
f(x) = \frac{x^{\alpha-1}(1-x)^{\beta-1}}{B(\alpha,\beta)} 
Where:
- α, β control the shape
- B (α, β) is the Beta function
5. Gamma Distribution
The Gamma distribution models the total time needed for multiple independent events to happen. It extends the exponential distribution to cover several tasks or events. For example, estimating the total time to finish three project tasks with varying durations.
- Models total time for multiple events
- Shape parameter (κ) controls event count
- Scale parameter (θ) controls event duration
PDF Formula:
f(x) = \frac{x^{k-1} e^{-x/\theta}}{\theta^k \Gamma(k)}, \quad x \ge 0 
6. Chi-Square Distribution
The Chi-Square distribution is used in hypothesis testing to check relationships between categorical variables. For example, testing if gender affects preference for coffee or tea. It helps determine if observed differences are due to chance.
- Used for testing independence between categories
- Works with contingency tables
- Degrees of freedom depend on number of categories
PDF Formula:
f(x) = \frac{1}{2^{k/2}\Gamma(k/2)} x^{k/2-1} e^{-x/2} 
Where:
- k = degrees of freedom
7. Log-Normal Distribution
The Log-Normal distribution models data that grows multiplicatively over time, like stock prices or income. If the logarithm of the data is normally distributed, the original data follows a log-normal distribution. It only models positive values.
- Models multiplicative growth processes
- Data can’t be negative
- Commonly used for stock prices and incomes
PDF Formula:
f(x) = \frac{1}{x\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left(-\frac{(\ln x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
