Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model learns from labelled data, meaning each input has a correct output. The model compares its predictions with actual results and improves over time to increase accuracy.
Its main features are:
- Each input has a known output
- Adjusts itself to reduce prediction errors
- Make accurate predictions on new data
- For example it recognizing handwritten digits from trained data
Types of Supervised Learning
Now, Supervised learning can be applied to two main types of problems:
- Classification: Where the output is a categorical variable (e.g., spam vs. non-spam emails, yes vs. no).
- Regression: Where the output is a continuous variable (e.g., predicting house prices, stock prices).
Let's first understand the classification and regression data through the table below:
Both the above figures have labelled data set as follows:
Figure A: It is a dataset of a shopping store that is useful in predicting whether a customer will purchase a particular product under consideration or not based on his/her gender, age and salary.
- Input: Gender, Age, Salary
- Output: Purchased i.e. 0 or 1; 1 means yes the customer will purchase and 0 means that the customer won't purchase it.
Figure B: It is a Meteorological dataset that serves the purpose of predicting wind speed based on different parameters.
- Input: Dew Point, Temperature, Pressure, Relative Humidity, Wind Direction
- Output: Wind Speed
Working of Supervised Machine Learning
The working of supervised machine learning follows these key steps:
1. Collect Labeled Data
- Gather a dataset where each input has a known correct output (label).
- Example: Images of handwritten digits with their actual numbers as labels.
2. Split the Dataset
- Divide the data into training data (about 80%) and testing data (about 20%).
- The model will learn from the training data and be evaluated on the testing data.
3. Train the Model
- Feed the training data (inputs and their labels) to a suitable supervised learning algorithm (like Decision Trees, SVM or Linear Regression).
- The model tries to find patterns that map inputs to correct outputs.
4. Validate and Test the Model
- Evaluate the model using testing data it has never seen before.
- The model predicts outputs and these predictions are compared with the actual labels to calculate accuracy or error.
5. Deploy and Predict on New Data
- Once the model performs well, it can be used to predict outputs for completely new, unseen data.
Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms
Supervised learning includes different types of algorithms used to predict outputs based on labeled data. Each algorithm is designed for specific tasks like prediction or classification.
- Linear Regression: Used to predict continuous values (e.g., price, temperature). It is simple and widely used.
- Logistic Regression: Logistic regression is a type of supervised learning classification algorithm that is used to predict a binary output variable.
- Decision Trees: Uses a tree-like structure where each node represents a decision and each leaf represents an outcome.
- Random Forests: Combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
- Support Vector Machine(SVM): Separates data into classes using a boundary (hyperplane). Support vectors help define this boundary.
- K-Nearest Neighbors: Predicts based on the closest data points. Results depend on the value of k and distance measure.
- Gradient Boosting: Builds models step-by-step by correcting errors of previous models, creating a strong model.
- Naive Bayes Algorithm: Based on probability and Bayes’ Theorem, assuming features are independent of each other.
Examples
- Fraud Detection in Banking: Uses labeled transaction data to identify and predict fraudulent activities.
- Parkinson Disease Prediction: Analyzes medical data such as voice recordings, motor symptoms, and clinical measurements to identify patterns and predict whether a patient has disease or not.
- Customer Churn Prediction: Uses historical customer data to predict whether a customer will leave a service.
- Cancer cell classification: Implements supervised learning for cancer cells based on their features and identifying them if they are ‘malignant’ or ‘benign.
- Stock Price Prediction: Uses past data to predict stock trends and support investment decisions.
Advantages
- Easy to understand and implement as it learns from labeled data.
- Provides high accuracy when sufficient labeled data is available.
- Works for both classification (spam detection, disease prediction) and regression (price forecasting).
- Can generalize well to unseen data with proper training and diverse datasets.
- Widely used in applications like speech recognition, medical diagnosis, sentiment analysis and fraud detection.
Disadvantages
- Requires large amounts of labeled data, which is expensive and time-consuming to prepare.
- Can be biased if the training data is unbalanced, leading to unfair or inaccurate predictions.
- May overfit the training data instead of learning general patterns, especially with small datasets.
- Performance can drop when applied to data that is very different from the training data.
- Not easily scalable for problems with a very large number of labels, such as in natural language tasks.
