Scikit-learn is an open-source Python library that simplifies the process of building machine learning models. It offers a clean and consistent interface that helps both beginners and experienced users work efficiently.
- Supports tasks like classification, regression, clustering and preprocessing
- Makes model building fast and reliable
- Provides ready-to-use tools for training and evaluation
- Reduces complexity by avoiding manual implementation of algorithms
Installing and Using Scikit-learn
Before we start building models we need to install Scikit-learn. It requires Python 3.8 or newer and depends on two important libraries: NumPy and SciPy. Make sure these are installed first.
To install Scikit-learn run the following command:
pip install -U scikit-learn
This will download and install the latest version of Scikit-learn along with its dependencies. Lets see various steps involved in the process of building Model using Scikit-learn library.
Step 1: Loading a Dataset
A dataset consists of:
- Features (X): Input variables that describe the data
- Target (y): The value we want to predict
Scikit-learn provides built-in datasets like Iris, Digits and Boston Housing. Using the Iris dataset:
- load_iris() loads the data
- X stores feature data
- y stores target labels
- feature_names and target_names give descriptive names
We can inspect the first few rows to understand the structure. For custom datasets, Pandas is commonly used to load external files such as CSVs.
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris 
iris = load_iris() 
X = iris.data 
y = iris.target 
  
feature_names = iris.feature_names 
target_names = iris.target_names 
  
print("Feature names:", feature_names) 
print("Target names:", target_names) 
print("\nType of X is:", type(X)) 
print("\nFirst 5 rows of X:\n", X[:5])
Output:
Sometimes we need to work on our own custom data then we load an external dataset. For this we can use the pandas library for easy loading and manipulating datasets.
For this you can refer to our article on How to import csv file in pandas?
Step 2: Splitting the Dataset
To evaluate a model fairly, we split data into:
- Training set: Used to train the model
- Testing set: Used to evaluate how well the model generalizes
Using train_test_split, we split the Iris dataset so that 60% is for training and 40% for testing (test_size=0.4). random_state=1 ensures reproducibility.
After splitting, we get:
- X_train, y_train -> Training data
- X_test, y_test -> Testing data
Checking the shapes ensures the data is split correctly.
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.4, random_state=1)
Now lets check the Shapes of the Splitted Data to ensures that both sets have correct proportions of data avoiding any potential errors in model evaluation or training.
print("X_train Shape:",  X_train.shape)
print("X_test Shape:", X_test.shape)
print("Y_train Shape:", y_train.shape)
print("Y_test Shape:", y_test.shape)
Output:
Step 3: Handling Categorical Data
Machine learning algorithms work with numerical inputs, so categorical (text) data must be converted into numbers. If not encoded properly, models can misinterpret categories. Scikit-learn provides multiple encoding methods:
1. Label Encoding: It converts each category into a unique integer. For example in a column with categories like 'cat', 'dog' and 'bird', it would convert them to 0, 1 and 2 respectively. This method works well when the categories have a meaningful order such as “Low”, “Medium” and “High”.
- LabelEncoder(): It is initialized to create an encoder object that will convert categorical values into numerical labels.
- fit_transform(): This method first fits the encoder to the categorical data and then transforms the categories into corresponding numeric labels.
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
categorical_feature = ['cat', 'dog', 'dog', 'cat', 'bird']
encoder = LabelEncoder()
encoded_feature = encoder.fit_transform(categorical_feature)
print("Encoded feature:", encoded_feature)
Output:
Encoded feature: [1 2 2 1 0]
2. One-Hot Encoding: One-Hot Encoding creates separate binary columns for each category. This is useful when categories do not have any natural ordering. Example: cat, dog, bird -> 3 new columns (cat/dog/bird) with 1s and 0s.
- Input must be reshaped into a 2D array
- OneHotEncoder(sparse_output=False) generates binary columns
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
import numpy as np
categorical_feature = ['cat', 'dog', 'dog', 'cat', 'bird']
categorical_feature = np.array(categorical_feature).reshape(-1, 1)
encoder = OneHotEncoder(sparse_output=False)
encoded_feature = encoder.fit_transform(categorical_feature)
print("OneHotEncoded feature:\n", encoded_feature)
Output:
Besides Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding there are other techniques like Mean Encoding.
Step 4: Training the Model
Now that our data is ready, it’s time to train a machine learning model. Scikit-learn has many algorithms with a consistent interface for training, prediction and evaluation. Here we’ll use Logistic Regression as an example.
Note: We will not go into the details of how the algorithm works as we are interested in understanding its implementation only.
- log_reg = LogisticRegression(max_iter=200): Creating a logistic regression classifier object.
- log_reg.fit(X_train, y_train): Using this the logistic regression model adjusts the model’s parameters to best fit the data.
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
log_reg = LogisticRegression(max_iter=200)
log_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)
Step 5: Make Predictions
Once trained we use the model to make predictions on the test data X_test by calling the predict method. This returns predicted labels y_pred.
- log_reg.predict: It uses trained logistic regression model to predict labels for the test data X_test.
y_pred = log_reg.predict(X_test)
Step 6: Evaluating Model Accuracy
Check how well our model is performing by comparing y_test and y_pred. Here we are using the metrics module's method accuracy_score.
from sklearn import metrics
print("Logistic Regression model accuracy:", metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
Output:
Logistic Regression model accuracy: 0.9666666666666667
Now we want our model to make predictions on new sample data. Then the sample input can simply be passed in the same way as we pass any feature matrix. Here we used it as sample = [[3, 5, 4, 2], [2, 3, 5, 4]]
sample = [[3, 5, 4, 2], [2, 3, 5, 4]]
preds = log_reg.predict(sample)
pred_species = [iris.target_names[p] for p in preds]
print("Predictions:", pred_species)
Output:
Predictions: [np.str_('virginica'), np.str_('virginica')]
