Naive Bayes is a machine learning classification algorithm that predicts the category of a data point using probability. It assumes that all features are independent of each other. Naive Bayes performs well in many real-world applications such as spam filtering, document categorization and sentiment analysis.
Here:
- Original data has two classes: green circles (y = 1) and red squares (y = 2).
- Estimate probability distribution along the first dimension i.e P(x_1 \mid y=1), \; P(x_1 \mid y=2)
- Estimate probability distribution along the second dimension i.e P(x_2 \mid y=1), \; P(x_2 \mid y=2)
- Combine both dimensions using conditional independence i.e P(x \mid y) = \prod_{\alpha} P(x_{\alpha} \mid y)
Key Features of Naive Bayes Classifiers
The main idea behind the Naive Bayes classifier is to use Bayes' Theorem to classify data based on the probabilities of different classes given the features of the data. It is used mostly in high-dimensional text classification
- The Naive Bayes Classifier is a simple probabilistic classifier and it has very few number of parameters which are used to build the ML models that can predict at a faster speed than other classification algorithms.
- It is a probabilistic classifier because it assumes that one feature in the model is independent of existence of another feature. In other words, each feature contributes to the predictions with no relation between each other.
- Naive Bayes Algorithm is used in spam filtration, Sentimental analysis, classifying articles and many more.
Why it is Called Naive Bayes?
It is named as "Naive" because it assumes the presence of one feature does not affect other features. The "Bayes" part of the name refers to its basis in Bayes’ Theorem.
Consider a fictional dataset that describes the weather conditions for playing a game of golf. Given the weather conditions, each tuple classifies the conditions as fit(“Yes”) or unfit(“No”) for playing golf. Here is a tabular representation of our dataset.
|  | Outlook | Temperature | Humidity | Windy | Play Golf | 
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Rainy | Hot | High | False | Yes | 
| 1 | Rainy | Hot | High | True | No | 
| 2 | Overcast | Hot | High | False | Yes | 
| 3 | Sunny | Mild | High | False | No | 
| 4 | Sunny | Cool | Normal | False | Yes | 
| 5 | Sunny | Cool | Normal | True | No | 
| 6 | Overcast | Cool | Normal | True | Yes | 
| 7 | Rainy | Mild | High | False | No | 
| 8 | Rainy | Cool | Normal | False | Yes | 
| 9 | Sunny | Mild | Normal | False | Yes | 
| 10 | Rainy | Mild | Normal | True | Yes | 
| 11 | Overcast | Mild | High | True | Yes | 
| 12 | Overcast | Hot | Normal | False | Yes | 
| 13 | Sunny | Mild | High | True | No | 
The dataset is divided into two parts i.e feature matrix and the response vector.
- Feature matrix contains all the vectors(rows) of dataset in which each vector consists of the value of dependent features. In above dataset, features are ‘Outlook’, ‘Temperature’, ‘Humidity’ and ‘Windy’.
- Response vector contains the value of class variable (prediction or output) for each row of feature matrix. In above dataset, the class variable name is ‘Play golf’.
Assumption of Naive Bayes
The fundamental Naive Bayes assumption is that each feature makes an:
- Feature independence: This means that when we are trying to classify something, we assume that each feature (or piece of information) in the data does not affect any other feature.
- Continuous features are normally distributed: If a feature is continuous, then it is assumed to be normally distributed within each class.
- Discrete features have multinomial distributions: If a feature is discrete, then it is assumed to have a multinomial distribution within each class.
- Features are equally important: All features are assumed to contribute equally to the prediction of the class label.
- No missing data: The data should not contain any missing values.
Introduction to Bayes' Theorem
Bayes’ Theorem provides a principled way to reverse conditional probabilities. It is defined as:
P(y|X) = \frac{P(X|y) \cdot P(y)}{P(X)} 
Where:
- P(y|X) : Posterior probability, probability of classy given featuresX
- P(X|y) : Likelihood, probability of featuresX given classy
- P(y) : Prior probability of classy
- P(X) : Marginal likelihood or evidence
Naive Bayes Working
1. Terminology
Consider a classification problem (like predicting if someone plays golf based on weather). Then:
- y is the class label (e.g. "Yes" or "No" for playing golf)
- X = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) is the feature vector (e.g. Outlook, Temperature, Humidity, Wind)
A sample row from the dataset:
X = \text{(Rainy, Hot, High, False)}, \quad y = \text{No} 
This represents:
What is the probability that someone will not play golf given that the weather is Rainy, Hot, High humidity and No wind?
2. The Naive Assumption
The "naive" in Naive Bayes comes from the assumption that all features are independent given the class. That is:
P(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n | y) = P(x_1 | y) \cdot P(x_2 | y) \cdots P(x_n | y) 
Thus, Bayes' theorem becomes:
P(y|x_1, ..., x_n) = \frac{P(y) \cdot \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i | y)}{P(X)} 
Since the denominator is constant for a given input, we can write:
P(y|x_1, ..., x_n) \propto P(y) \cdot \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i | y) 
3. Constructing the Naive Bayes Classifier
We compute the posterior for each class 
\hat{y} = \arg\max_{y} P(y) \cdot \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i | y) 
This becomes our Naive Bayes classifier.
4. Example: Weather Dataset
Let’s take a dataset used for predicting if golf is played based on:
- Outlook: Sunny, Rainy, Overcast
- Temperature: Hot, Mild, Cool
- Humidity: High, Normal
- Wind: True, False
Example Input: 
Goal: Predict if golf will be played (Yes or No).
5. Pre-computation from Dataset
Class Probabilities:
From dataset of 14 rows:
- P(\text{Yes}) = \frac{9}{14}
- P(\text{No}) = \frac{5}{14}
Conditional Probabilities (Tables 1–4):
6. Calculate Posterior Probabilities
For Class = Yes:
P(\text{Yes | today}) \propto \frac{2}{9} \cdot \frac{2}{9} \cdot \frac{6}{9} \cdot \frac{6}{9} \cdot \frac{9}{14} P(\text{Yes | today}) \approx 0.01411 
For Class = No:
P(\text{No | today}) \propto \frac{3}{5} \cdot \frac{2}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{2}{5} \cdot \frac{5}{14} P(\text{No | today}) \approx 0.00686 
7. Normalize Probabilities
To compare:
P(\text{Yes | today}) = \frac{0.01411}{0.01411 + 0.00686} \approx 0.673 P(\text{No | today}) = \frac{0.00686}{0.01411 + 0.00686} \approx 0.327 
8. Final Prediction
Since:
P(\text{Yes | today}) > P(\text{No | today}) The model predicts: Yes (Play Golf)
Naive Bayes for Continuous Features
For continuous features, we assume a Gaussian distribution:
P(x_i | y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2_y}} \exp\left( -\frac{(x_i - \mu_y)^2}{2\sigma^2_y} \right) 
Where:
- \mu_y is the mean of featurex_i for classy
- \sigma^2_y is the variance of featurex_i for classy
This leads to what is called Gaussian Naive Bayes.
Types of Naive Bayes Model
There are three types of Naive Bayes Model :
1. Gaussian Naive Bayes
In Gaussian Naive Bayes, continuous values associated with each feature are assumed to be distributed according to a Gaussian distribution. A Gaussian distribution is also called Normal distribution When plotted, it gives a bell shaped curve which is symmetric about the mean of the feature values as shown below:
2. Multinomial Naive Bayes
Multinomial Naive Bayes is used when features represent the frequency of terms (such as word counts) in a document. It is commonly applied in text classification, where term frequencies are important.
3. Bernoulli Naive Bayes
Bernoulli Naive Bayes deals with binary features, where each feature indicates whether a word appears or not in a document. It is suited for scenarios where the presence or absence of terms is more relevant than their frequency. Both models are widely used in document classification tasks
Advantages
- Easy to implement and computationally efficient.
- Effective in cases with a large number of features.
- Performs well even with limited training data.
- It performs well in the presence of categorical features.
- For numerical features data is assumed to come from normal distributions
Disadvantages
- Assumes that features are independent, which may not always hold in real-world data.
- Can be influenced by irrelevant attributes.
- May assign zero probability to unseen events, leading to poor generalization.
Applications
- Spam Email Filtering: Classifies emails as spam or non-spam based on features.
- Text Classification: Used in sentiment analysis, document categorization and topic classification.
- Medical Diagnosis: Helps in predicting the likelihood of a disease based on symptoms.
- Credit Scoring: Evaluates creditworthiness of individuals for loan approval.
- Weather Prediction: Classifies weather conditions based on various factors.
