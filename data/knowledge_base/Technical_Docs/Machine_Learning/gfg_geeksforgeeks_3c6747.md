Traditional models like decision trees and random forests are easy to interpret but may lack accuracy on complex data. XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is an optimized gradient boosting algorithm that combines multiple weak models into a stronger, high-performance model.
- It uses decision trees as base learners, building them sequentially so each tree corrects errors from the previous one and it is known as boosting.
- It features parallel processing for faster training on large datasets and allows parameter customization to optimize performance for specific problems.
How XGBoost Works?
It builds decision trees sequentially with each tree attempting to correct the mistakes made by the previous one. The process can be broken down as follows:
- Start with a base learner: The first model decision tree is trained on the data. In regression tasks this base model simply predicts the average of the target variable.
- Calculate the errors: After training the first tree the errors between the predicted and actual values are calculated.
- Train the next tree: The next tree is trained on the errors of the previous tree. This step attempts to correct the errors made by the first tree.
- Repeat the process: This process continues with each new tree trying to correct the errors of the previous trees until a stopping criterion is met.
- Combine the predictions: The final prediction is the sum of the predictions from all the trees.
Mathematics Behind XGBoost Algorithm
It can be viewed as iterative process where we start with an initial prediction often set to zero. After which each tree is added to reduce errors. Mathematically the model can be represented as:
\hat{y}_{i} = \sum_{k=1}^{K} f_k(x_i) 
Where:
- \hat{y}_{i} is the final predicted value for thei^{th} data point
- K is the number of trees in the ensemble
- f_k(x_i) represents the prediction of theK^{th} tree for thei^{th} data point.
The objective function in XGBoost consists of two parts i.e a loss function and a regularization term. The loss function measures how well the model fits the data and the regularization term simplify complex trees. The general form of the loss function is:
obj(\theta) = \sum_{i}^{n} l(y_{i}, \hat{y}_{i}) + \sum_{k=1}^K \Omega(f_{k}) \\ 
Where:
- l(y_{i}, \hat{y}_{i}) is the loss function which computes the difference between the true valuey_i  and the predicted value\hat{y}_i ,
- \Omega(f_{k}) \\ is the regularization term which discourages overly complex trees.
Now instead of fitting the model all at once we optimize the model iteratively. We start with an initial prediction 
\\ \hat{y}_i^{(t)} = \hat{y}_i^{(t-1)} + f_t(x_i) 
Where:
- \hat{y}_i^{(t-1)} is the prediction from the previous iteration
- f_t(x_i) is the prediction of thet^{th} tree for thei^{th} data point.
The regularization term 
\Omega(f_t) = \gamma T + \frac{1}{2}\lambda \sum_{j=1}^T w_j^2 
Where:
- \Tau is the number of leaves in the tree
- \gamma is a regularization parameter that controls the complexity of the tree
- \lambda is a parameter that penalizes the squared weight of the leavesw_j 
Finally, when deciding how to split the nodes in the tree we compute the information gain for every possible split. The information gain for a split is calculated as:
Gain = \frac{1}{2} \left[\frac{G_L^2}{H_L+\lambda}+\frac{G_R^2}{H_R+\lambda}-\frac{(G_L+G_R)^2}{H_L+H_R+\lambda}\right] - \gamma 
Where:
- G_L, G_R are the sums of gradients in the left and right child nodes
- H_L, H_R are the sums of Hessians in the left and right child nodes
By calculating the information gain for every possible split at each node XGBoost selects the split that results in the largest gain which effectively reduces the errors and improves the model's performance.
How XGBoost Improves Traditional Gradient Boosting
XGBoost extends traditional gradient boosting by including regularization elements in the objective function, XGBoost improves generalization and prevents overfitting.
1. Preventing Overfitting
XGBoost incorporates several techniques to reduce overfitting and improve model generalization:
- Learning rate (eta): Controls each tree’s contribution i.e a lower value makes the model more conservative.
- Regularization: Adds penalties to complexity to prevent overly complex trees.
- Pruning: Trees grow depth-wise and splits that do not improve the objective function are removed, keeping trees simpler and faster.
- Combination effect: Using learning rate, regularization and pruning together enhances robustness and reduces overfitting.
2. Tree Structure
XGBoost builds trees level-wise (breadth-first) rather than the conventional depth-first approach, adding nodes at each depth before moving to the next level.
- Best splits: Evaluates every possible split for each feature at each level and selects the one that minimizes the objective function like MSE for regression and cross-entropy for classification.
- Feature prioritization: Level-wise growth reduces overhead, as all features are considered simultaneously, avoiding repeated evaluations.
- Benefit: Handles complex feature interactions effectively by considering all features at the same depth.
3. Handling Missing Data
XGBoost manages missing values robustly during training and prediction using a sparsity-aware approach.
- Sparsity-Aware Split Finding: Treats missing values as a separate category when evaluating splits.
- Default direction: During tree building, missing values follow a default branch.
- Prediction: Instances with missing features follow the learned default branch.
- Benefit: Ensures robust predictions even with incomplete input data.
4. Cache-Aware Access
XGBoost optimizes memory usage to speed up computations by taking advantage of CPU cache.
- Memory hierarchy: Frequently accessed data is stored in the CPU cache.
- Spatial locality: Nearby data is accessed together to reduce memory access time.
- Benefit: Reduces reliance on slower main memory, improving training speed.
5. Approximate Greedy Algorithm
To efficiently handle large datasets, XGBoost uses an approximate method to find optimal splits.
- Weighted quantiles: Quickly estimate the best split without checking every possibility.
- Efficiency: Reduces computational overhead while maintaining accuracy.
- Benefit: Ideal for large datasets where full evaluation is costly.
