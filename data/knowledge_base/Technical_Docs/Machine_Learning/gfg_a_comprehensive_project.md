4. Data Preprocessing and model building
Data preprocessing prepares the dataset for modeling by ensuring it is clean, consistent and in a machine readable format. These steps help improve model performance and reliability.
Step 1: Import required libraries
We will import libraries like pandas, numpy and scikit learn
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
Step 2: Load the Dataset
Read the dataset with the correct separator to ensure proper structure.
df = pd.read_csv("your dataset path", sep=';')
df.head()
Output:
Step 3: Basic Exploration
Understand the structure and data types.
print(df.shape)
print(df.info())
Output:
Step 4: Handle Missing Values
Check and confirm missing values.
df.isnull().sum()
No missing values found, so no further preprocessing required to handle missing values.
Step 5: Drop Irrelevant Features
Remove columns that do not contribute to prediction.
df = df.drop(columns=['id'], errors='ignore')
Step 6: Separate Features and Target
Split dataset into input (X) and output (y).
X = df.drop(columns=['Target'])
y = df['Target']
Step 7: Encode Target Variable
Convert target labels into numerical form.
le = LabelEncoder()
y = le.fit_transform(y)
Step 8: Feature Encoding
- Convert categorical features into numerical format.
- One-Hot Encoding (for nominal data like Course)
X = pd.get_dummies(X, columns=['Course'], drop_first=True)
Step 9: Feature Scaling
Normalize numerical features for better model performance.
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
Step 10: Train-Test Split
Split data for training and evaluation.
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
Step 11: Handle Imbalance data
Class imbalance can be addressed using techniques like SMOTE
sm = SMOTE()
X_train, y_train = sm.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)
Step 12: Train a Model
Start with a simple and reliable model like Random Forest.
model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
Step 13: Make Predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
Step 14: Evaluate the Model
Use multiple metrics for better understanding.
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
Output:
5. Hyperparameter Tuning
After training the initial model, the next step is to optimize its performance by tuning hyperparameters. This helps find the best configuration for better accuracy and generalization in predicting student academic risk.
Step 1: Set Up MLflow for Experiment Tracking
MLflow is used to track experiments, compare models and log parameters, metrics and results.
- mlflow.set_experiment(...) creates a project/experiment to group your runs
mlflow.set_experiment("Student_Risk_Prediction")
Step 2: Perform Hyperparameter Tuning
Use GridSearchCV to find the best parameters for the model.
param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 200],
    'max_depth': [10, 20, None],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5]
}
grid = GridSearchCV(RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42),
                    param_grid,
                    cv=3,
                    scoring='accuracy',
                    n_jobs=-1)
grid.fit(X_train, y_train)
Output:
Step 3: Log Results with MLflow
Track best parameters and performance.
with mlflow.start_run():
    mlflow.log_params(grid.best_params_)
    mlflow.log_metric("best_accuracy", grid.best_score_)
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(grid.best_estimator_, "model")
6. Model Evaluation
After hyperparameter tuning, the best model is evaluated to ensure it performs well on unseen data. This step validates model performance and prepares it for real world use.
Step 1: Load the Best Model
Load the model selected during hyperparameter tuning.
best_model = grid.best_estimator_
Step 2: Make Predictions
Use the model to generate predictions on test data.
y_pred = best_model.predict(X_test)
Step 3: Evaluate Performance
Measure how well the model performs using key metrics.
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
Output:
- Overall accuracy ~75.7% means moderate performance
- Class 2 shows best performance, recall = 0.89, F1-score = 0.84
- Class 1 shows poor performance, precision = 0.48, recall = 0.46
- Macro F1-score = 0.69 means balanced but slightly uneven across classes
- Weighted F1-score = 0.75 means better performance on classes with more samples
Step 4: Serialize the trained model
import joblib
joblib.dump(best_model, "model.pkl")

7. Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) with CML
CI/CD automates model training, evaluation, reporting and deployment whenever changes are pushed to the repository. In this project, GitHub Actions and CML are used to track performance and simulate deployment of the student risk prediction model.
Step 1: Workflow Overview
- Code Checkout: Fetch latest code from repository.
- Environment Setup: Install Python and dependencies.
- Training: Train and evaluate the model.
- Reporting: Generate metrics and plots using CML.
- Deployment: Build and run Docker container (CD step).

        run: |
          docker run -d -p 8000:8000 student-risk-api
8. Model Deployment with FastAPI
After training and evaluating the model, the final step is deployment to enable real time predictions. FastAPI is used to build a high performance API for the student risk prediction model.
Step 1: Initialize FastAPI App
Initialize the application and serve static files for the frontend.
from fastapi import FastAPI
import pandas as pd
import uvicorn
app = FastAPI()
Step 2: Load Trained Model
import joblib
model_pipe = joblib.load("model.pkl")
Step 3: Define Prediction Endpoint
This endpoint accepts input data and returns predicted student risk.
from fastapi import HTTPException
@app.post("/predict")
def predict(data: dict):
    try:
        df = pd.DataFrame([data])
        prediction = model_pipe.predict(df)
        return {"prediction": prediction.tolist()[0]}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
Step 4: Run the API
if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run("app:app", host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
Step 5: Test the API
- Open: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
- Use Swagger UI to send input and get predictions
9. Dockerization
Docker is used to containerize the FastAPI application, making the model portable, consistent and easy to deploy across environments.
Step 1: Dockerfile Configuration
The Dockerfile defines the environment and dependencies required to run the API.
 python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY app.py /app/
COPY model.pkl /app/
COPY requirements.txt /app/
COPY static/ /app/static/
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "app:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
Step 2: Build and Run Container
 build -t academic-success-predictor .
docker run -p 8000:8000 academic-success-predictor
Step 3: Live Application Output
- The container runs successfully and serves the application on localhost:8000.
- Users can input student details through the interface, and the model returns predictions in real time (e.g., predicted academic success class shown after submission).
Step 4: Logs and API Activity
Docker logs confirm:
- Server startup using Uvicorn
- API requests (POST /predictions) returning status 200 OK
- Successful model inference without errors
