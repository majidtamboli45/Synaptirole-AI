Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It tries to find the best boundary known as hyperplane that separates different classes in the data. It is useful when you want to do binary classification like spam vs. not spam or cat vs. dog.
The main goal of SVM is to maximize the margin between the two classes. The larger the margin the better the model performs on new and unseen data.
Key Concepts
- Hyperplane: A decision boundary separating different classes in feature space and is represented by the equation wx + b = 0 in linear classification.
- Support Vectors: The closest data points to the hyperplane, crucial for determining the hyperplane and margin in SVM.
- Margin: The distance between the hyperplane and the support vectors. SVM aims to maximize this margin for better classification performance.
- Kernel: A function that maps data to a higher-dimensional space enabling SVM to handle non-linearly separable data.
- Hard Margin: A maximum-margin hyperplane that perfectly separates the data without misclassifications.
- Soft Margin: Allows some misclassifications by introducing slack variables, balancing margin maximization and misclassification penalties when data is not perfectly separable.
- C: A regularization term balancing margin maximization and misclassification penalties. A higher C value forces stricter penalty for misclassifications.
- Hinge Loss: A loss function penalizing misclassified points or margin violations and is combined with regularization in SVM.
- Dual Problem: Involves solving for Lagrange multipliers associated with support vectors, facilitating the kernel trick and efficient computation.
Working of Support Vector Machine Algorithm
The key idea behind the SVM algorithm is to find the hyperplane that best separates two classes by maximizing the margin between them. This margin is the distance from the hyperplane to the nearest data points (support vectors) on each side.
The best hyperplane also known as the hard margin is the one that maximizes the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points from both classes. This ensures a clear separation between the classes. So from the above figure, we choose L2 as hard margin. Let's consider a scenario like shown below:
Here, we have one blue ball in the boundary of the red ball.
How does SVM classify the data?
The blue ball in the boundary of red ones is an outlier of blue balls. The SVM algorithm has the characteristics to ignore the outlier and finds the best hyperplane that maximizes the margin. SVM can be sensitive to outliers, especially in the case of a hard margin, while soft margin SVM helps reduce their impact by allowing some misclassifications.
A soft margin allows for some misclassifications or violations of the margin to improve generalization. The SVM optimizes the following equation to balance margin maximization and penalty minimization:
\text{Objective Function} = (\frac{1}{\text{margin}}) + \lambda \sum \text{penalty } 
The penalty used for violations is often hinge loss which has the following behavior:
- If a data point is correctly classified and lies outside the margin, there is no penalty (loss = 0). If it is correctly classified but lies within the margin or is misclassified, the hinge loss is greater than 0.
- If a point is incorrectly classified or violates the margin the hinge loss increases proportionally to the distance of the violation.
Till now we were talking about linearly separable data that separates group of blue balls and red balls by a straight line/linear line.
What if data is not linearly separable?
When data is not linearly separable i.e it can't be divided by a straight line, SVM uses a technique called kernels to map the data into a higher-dimensional space where it becomes separable. This transformation helps SVM find a decision boundary even for non-linear data.
A kernel is a function that maps data points into a higher-dimensional space without explicitly computing the coordinates in that space. This allows SVM to work efficiently with non-linear data by implicitly performing the mapping. For example consider data points that are not linearly separable. By applying a kernel function SVM transforms the data points into a higher-dimensional space where they become linearly separable.
- Linear Kernel: For linear separability.
- Polynomial Kernel: Maps data into a polynomial space.
- Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel: Transforms data into a space based on distances between data points.
In this case the new variable y is created as a function of distance from the origin.
Mathematical Computation of SVM
Consider a binary classification problem with two classes, labeled as +1 and -1. We have a training dataset consisting of input feature vectors X and their corresponding class labels Y. The equation for the linear hyperplane can be written as:
w^Tx+ b = 0 
Where:
- w is the normal vector to the hyperplane (the direction perpendicular to it).
- b is the offset or bias term representing the distance of the hyperplane from the origin along the normal vectorw .
Distance from a Data Point to the Hyperplane
The distance between a data point 
d_i = \frac{w^T x_i + b}{||w||} 
where ||w|| represents the Euclidean norm of the weight vector w.
Linear SVM Classifier
Distance from a Data Point to the Hyperplane:
\hat{y} = \left\{ \begin{array}{cl} 1 & : \ w^Tx+b \geq 0 \\ -1 & : \ w^Tx+b < 0 \end{array} \right. 
Where 
Optimization Problem for SVM
For a linearly separable dataset the goal is to find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the two classes while ensuring that all data points are correctly classified. This leads to the following optimization problem:
\underset{w,b}{\text{minimize}}\frac{1}{2}\left\| w \right\|^{2} 
Subject to the constraint:
y_i(w^Tx_i + b) \geq 1 \;for\; i = 1, 2,3, \cdots,m 
Where:
- y_i  is the class label (+1 or -1) for each training instance.
- x_i  is the feature vector for thei -th training instance.
- m is the total number of training instances.
The condition 
Soft Margin in Linear SVM Classifier
In the presence of outliers or non-separable data the SVM allows some misclassification by introducing slack variables 
\underset{w, b}{\text{minimize }} \frac{1}{2} \|w\|^2 + C \sum_{i=1}^{m} \zeta_i 
Subject to the constraints:
y_i (w^T x_i + b) \geq 1 - \zeta_i \quad \text{and} \quad \zeta_i \geq 0 \quad \text{for } i = 1, 2, \dots, m 
Where:
- C is a regularization parameter that controls the trade-off between margin maximization and penalty for misclassifications.
- \zeta_i  are slack variables that represent the degree of violation of the margin by each data point.
Dual Problem for SVM
The dual problem involves maximizing the Lagrange multipliers associated with the support vectors. This transformation allows solving the SVM optimization using kernel functions for non-linear classification.
The dual objective function is given by:
\max_{\alpha} \; \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{j=1}^{m} \alpha_i \alpha_j t_i t_j K(x_i, x_j)- \sum_{i=1}^{m} \alpha_i 
Where:
- \alpha_i  are the Lagrange multipliers associated with thei^{th} training sample.
- t_i  is the class label for thei^{th} -th training sample.
- K(x_i, x_j) is the kernel function that computes the similarity between data pointsx_i  andx_j . The kernel allows SVM to handle non-linear classification problems by mapping data into a higher-dimensional space.
The dual formulation optimizes the Lagrange multipliers 
SVM Decision Boundary
Once the dual problem is solved, the decision boundary is given by:
w = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \alpha_i t_i K(x_i, x) + b 
Where 
t_i (w^T x_i - b) = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad b = w^T x_i - t_i 
Where 
This completes the mathematical framework of the Support Vector Machine algorithm which allows for both linear and non-linear classification using the dual problem and kernel trick.
Types of Support Vector Machine
Based on the nature of the decision boundary, Support Vector Machines (SVM) can be divided into two main parts:
Linear SVM
- Linear SVMs use a linear decision boundary to separate the data points of different classes.
- When the data can be precisely linearly separated, linear SVMs are very suitable.
- This means that a single straight line (in 2D) or a hyperplane (in higher dimensions) can entirely divide the data points into their respective classes.
- A hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the classes is the decision boundary.
Non-Linear SVM
- Non-Linear SVM can be used to classify data when it cannot be separated into two classes by a straight line (in the case of 2D).
- By using kernel functions, nonlinear SVMs can handle nonlinearly separable data.
- The original input data is transformed by these kernel functions into a higher-dimensional feature space where the data points can be linearly separated.
- A linear SVM is used to locate a nonlinear decision boundary in this modified space.
