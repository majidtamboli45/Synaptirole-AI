# What is Machine Learning Pipeline?

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blogs/machine-learning-pipeline

A Machine Learning Pipeline is a systematic workflow designed to automate the process of building, training, and deploying ML models. It includes several steps, such as:
- Data Collection
- Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training
- Evaluation
- Deployment.
Rather than managing each step individually, pipelines help simplify and standardize the workflow, making machine learning development faster, more efficient and scalable. They also enhance data management by enabling the extraction, transformation, and loading of data from various sources.
Steps to build Machine Learning Pipeline
A machine learning pipeline is a step-by-step process that automates data preparation, model training and deployment. Here, we will discuss the key steps:
Step 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Gather data from sources like databases, APIs or CSV files.
- Clean the data by handling missing values, duplicates and errors.
- Normalize and standardize numerical values.
- Convert categorical variables into a machine readable format.
Step 2: Feature Engineering
- Select the most important features for better model performance.
- Create new features for feature extraction or transformation.
Step 3: Data splitting
- Divide the dataset into training, validation and testing sets.
- When dealing with imbalanced datasets, use random sampling.
Step 4: Model Selection & Training
- Choose the best algorithm based on the problem includes classification, regression, Clustering etc.
- Train the model using the training dataset.
Step 5: Model evaluation & Optimization
- Test the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall and other metrics.
- Tune hyperparameters using Grid Search or Random Search and avoiding overfitting using techniques like cross- validation.
Step 6: Model Deployment
- Deploy the trained model using Flask, FastAPI, TensorFlow and cloud services.
- Save the trained model for real-world applications.
Step 7: Continuous learning & Monitoring
- Automates the pipeline using MLOps tools like MLflow or Kubeflow.
- Update the model with new data to maintain accuracy.
Implementation for model Training
1. Import Libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
2. Load and Prepare the data
# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/master/titanic.csv")
# Select relevant features
features = ['Pclass', 'Sex', 'Age', 'SibSp', 'Parch', 'Fare', 'Embarked']
df = df[features + ['Survived']].dropna()  # Drop rows with missing values
# Display the first few rows
print(df.head())
Output:
3. Define Preprocessing Steps
# Define numerical and categorical features
num_features = ['Age', 'SibSp', 'Parch', 'Fare']
cat_features = ['Pclass', 'Sex', 'Embarked']
# Define transformers
num_transformer = StandardScaler()  # Standardization for numerical features
cat_transformer = OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore')  # One-hot encoding for categorical features
# Combine transformers into a preprocessor
preprocessor = ColumnTransformer([
    ('num', num_transformer, num_features),
    ('cat', cat_transformer, cat_features)
])
4. Split the data for training and Testing
# Define target and features
X = df[features]
y = df['Survived']
# Split into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
# Display the shape of the data
print(f"Training set shape: {X_train.shape}")
print(f"Testing set shape: {X_test.shape}")
Output:
Training set shape: (567, 7)
Testing set shape: (143, 7)
5. Build and Train model
# Define the pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('preprocessor', preprocessor),  # Data transformation
    ('classifier', RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42))  # ML model
])
# Train the model
pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)
print("Model training complete!")
Output:
Model training complete!
6. Evaluate the Model
# Make predictions
y_pred = pipeline.predict(X_test)
# Compute accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
Output:
Model Accuracy: 0.76
7. Save and Load the Model
import joblib
# Save the trained pipeline
joblib.dump(pipeline, 'ml_pipeline.pkl')
# Load the model
loaded_pipeline = joblib.load('ml_pipeline.pkl')
# Predict using the loaded model
sample_data = pd.DataFrame([{'Pclass': 3, 'Sex': 'male', 'Age': 25, 'SibSp': 0, 'Parch': 0, 'Fare': 7.5, 'Embarked': 'S'}])
prediction = loaded_pipeline.predict(sample_data)
print(f"Prediction: {'Survived' if prediction[0] == 1 else 'Did not Survive'}")
Output:
Prediction: Did not Survive
