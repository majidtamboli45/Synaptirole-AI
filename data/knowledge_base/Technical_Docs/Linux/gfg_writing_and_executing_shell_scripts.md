# Writing and executing shell scripts

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-unix/how-to-create-a-shell-script-in-linux/

A shell script is a collection of commands written in a scripting language that is interpreted by a shell in an operating system such as Linux. The shell acts as a command-line interface (CLI), allowing users to interact with the operating system by executing commands.
Shell scripts are commonly used to:
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Execute a sequence of commands
- Simplify system administration
- Improve efficiency and consistency
Writing Your First Shell Script
Step 1: Choose a Text Editor
Before you start writing your shell script, you need a text editor. Popular choices include Nano, Vim, and Emacs. For beginners, Nano is user-friendly and easy to use.
Command:
nano myscript.sh
Step 2: Write Your Script
Let's create a simple script that prints "Hello, World!" to the terminal.
Script:
#!/bin/bash
# This is a simple shell script
echo "Hello, World!"
Explanation:
- The first line (#!/bin/bash) is called the shebang. It specifies the shell that should be used to interpret the script.
- Lines starting with # are comments. They are ignored by the shell and help improve readability.
- The echo command prints text to the terminal.
Step 3: Save and Exit
Save the script in Nano editor by pressing Ctrl + O, then Enter to confirm, and finally Ctrl + X to exit.
Step 4: Make the Script Executable
To run the script, you need to make it executable:
chmod +x myscript.sh
Executing Shell Scripts
Running the Script
Now that your script is executable, you can run it by typing.
Command:
./myscript.sh
- The ./ indicates that the script is located in the current directory.
Output:
Alternative Method (Without Changing Permissions)
A script can also be executed by explicitly specifying the interpreter:
Command:
bash myscript.sh
- In this case, execute permission is not required.
Variables and Input
Shell scripts can use variables to store and manipulate data. Here's an example:
Script:
#!/bin/bash
# Get user input
echo "Enter your name:"
read name
# Print a greeting
echo "Hello, $name!"
- read: Stores user input in the variable name
- $name retrieves the value of the variable
- Run the script, and it will prompt you to enter your name.
Output:
Control Flow
Shell scripts support basic control flow structures like if statements, case statements, and loops.
Example:
This script checks whether the entered number is even or odd.
Script:
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter a number:"
read num
if [ $((num % 2)) -eq 0 ]; then
echo "$num is even."
else
echo "$num is odd."
fi
Output:
