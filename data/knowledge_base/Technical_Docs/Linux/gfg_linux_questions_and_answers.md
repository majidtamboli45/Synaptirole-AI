# Linux Interview Questions and Answers

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-unix/linux-interview-questions/

Linux is an open-source operating system widely used for servers, cloud computing, cybersecurity, DevOps and embedded systems. It is a fundamental skill for system administrators, developers and security professionals, making it a common topic in technical interviews. It covers:
- File System: Managing files and directories.
- Shell Commands: Executing system commands.
- Users & Permissions: Controlling user access.
- Processes & Services: Managing running processes and services.
- Networking: Configuring and troubleshooting networks.
Beginner Level Interview Questions
1. What is the Linux Kernel?
The kernel is the core of Linux. It manages CPU scheduling, memory, hardware devices, processes, networking and file systems.
2. What is the difference between Linux and Unix?
- Source: Linux is open-source; Unix is mostly proprietary.
- Cost: Linux is free; Unix is usually commercial.
- Development: Linux is community-developed; Unix is vendor-developed.
- Versions: Linux has many distributions; Unix has vendor-specific versions.
- Examples: Linux - Ubuntu, Debian, Kali | Unix - AIX, HP-UX, Solaris.
3. What is the root user?
The root user is the superuser with unrestricted access to the entire system, including system files, users, services and hardware.
4. What is the difference between CLI and GUI?
Common difference between CLI and GUI:
- Interface: It uses text commands; GUI uses graphical elements.
- Performance: It is faster and lightweight; GUI uses more system resources.
- Automation: It is ideal for scripting and automation; GUI is not.
- Ease of Use: It requires command knowledge; GUI is more user-friendly.
- Usage: It is preferred by system administrators and DevOps engineers; GUI is preferred for everyday desktop tasks.
5. What is the Linux file system hierarchy?
Linux organizes files in a hierarchical tree structure starting from the root directory (/). Common directories:
- /bin: Essential user commands.
- /etc: Configuration files.
- /home: User home directories.
- /var: Variable data (logs, spool).
- /tmp: Temporary files.
- /usr: User applications and libraries.
6. What is the difference between an absolute path and a relative path?
The difference between an absolute path and a relative path are:
- Absolute Path: Starts from the root (/ ) and specifies the complete file location.
- Relative Path: Starts from the current working directory.
- Dependency: Absolute paths are independent of the current location; relative paths depend on it.
- Example: Absolute - /home/user/file.txt | Relative - Documents/file.txt
7. What is the difference between a hard link and a soft link?
The difference between hard link and soft link are:
- Inode: Hard link shares the same inode; soft link has a different inode.
- Filesystem: Hard links work only within the same filesystem; soft links can span multiple filesystems.
- Target: Hard link remains valid if the original file is deleted; soft link becomes broken if the target is deleted.
- Directories: Hard links are generally not created for directories; soft links can point to both files and directories.
8. What does pwd do?
The pwd (Print Working Directory) command displays the absolute path of the current working directory.
pwd
9. What is an inode?
An inode is a data structure that stores metadata about a file, including permissions, owner, timestamps and disk block locations. It does not store the file name.
10. How do you check the Linux kernel and operating system version?
The kernel version helps verify compatibility, while the operating system version identifies the installed Linux distribution.

rm -rf directory_name
13. How do you create a directory?
The mkdir command creates a new directory.
mkdir directory_name
14. How do you search for files?
The find command searches for files and directories based on name, type, size, owner or other attributes.
find /home -name "*.txt"
15. What is the locate command?
Locate searches files using a pre-built database, making it much faster than find.
locate passwd
16. What is command history?
Linux histroy commnad dispalys and stores previously executed commands, allowing users to review and reuse them.
history
17. How do you clear the terminal?
The clear command clears the terminal screen without closing the session.

- w (Write): Modify a file or create/delete files in a directory.
- x (Execute): Run a file as a program or access a directory.
38. What do the permissions rwxr-xr-- mean?

SetUID, SetGID and Sticky Bits in Linux File Permissions are:
- SUID (Set User ID): Executes a file with the owner's privileges.
- SGID (Set Group ID): Executes a file with the group's privileges or causes new files in a directory to inherit the directory's group.
- Sticky Bit: Prevents users from deleting files owned by others in a shared directory (e.g., /tmp).
chmod u+s file
chmod g+s directory
chmod +t directory
41. What is the difference between /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow?
- /etc/passwd: Stores user account information.

Advanced Interview Questions
56. Explain the Linux boot process.
Linux boot process follow these steps for booting:
- BIOS/UEFI initializes hardware.
- GRUB bootloader loads the Linux kernel.
- Kernel initializes hardware and mounts the root filesystem.
- systemd (PID 1) starts system services.
- User login prompt or GUI is displayed.
57. What is the difference between BIOS and UEFI?
The difference BIOS and UEFI is:
- BIOS: Legacy firmware, supports MBR (up to 2 TB).
- UEFI: Modern firmware, supports GPT (>2 TB), Secure Boot and faster startup.
58. What is GRUB?
GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader) is the bootloader that loads the Linux kernel and allows users to select the operating system during startup. Command:
grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
59. What is systemd?
Systemd is the default init system in most Linux distributions. It manages system startup, services, logging and dependencies. Check PID 1:
ps -p 1
60. How do you manage services using systemctl?
Systemctl is used to start, stop, restart, enable, disable and check service status.
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl stop nginx
sudo systemctl restart nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
sudo systemctl status nginx
61. What is the difference between cron and at?
crontab -e
at 10:00
62. What is LVM?
LVM (Logical Volume Manager) provides flexible disk management by allowing logical volumes to be resized, extended or reduced without repartitioning.
63. What is swap memory?
Swap is disk space used as virtual memory when physical RAM is exhausted.
swapon --show
free -h
64. What is SELinux and different SELinux modes?
SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) is a Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system that restricts processes based on security policies. Different modes:
- Enforcing: Policies are enforced.
- Permissive: Violations are logged but not blocked.
- Disabled: SELinux is turned off.
getenforce
65. How do you troubleshoot high CPU usage?
Identify CPU-intensive processes, then analyze or terminate them if necessary.
top
htop
ps aux --sort=-%cpu
66. What are zombie and orphan processes?
- Zombie: A terminated process whose parent has not collected its exit status.
- Orphan: A running process whose parent has terminated. It is adopted by systemd (PID 1).
67. What is the OOM Killer?
The Out-Of-Memory (OOM) Killer is a Linux kernel mechanism that terminates processes when the system runs out of memory to prevent a system crash.
68. A production Linux server is slow. How would you troubleshoot it?
Follow a systematic approach:
- Check CPU usage (top, htop).
- Check memory and swap (free -h).
- Check disk usage (df -h, du -sh).
- Check load average (uptime).
- Check running processes (ps aux).
- Review system logs (journalctl, /var/log).
- Check network activity (ss, netstat, tcpdump).
