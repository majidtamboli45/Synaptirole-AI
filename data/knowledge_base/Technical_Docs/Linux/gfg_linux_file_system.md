# Linux File System

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-unix/linux-file-system/

The Linux File System is a structured method of storing and organizing data on a Linux machine. It arranges files in a hierarchical directory format starting from the root directory (/).
- All files and directories in Linux originate from a single root directory (/).
- It follows a hierarchical tree structure, making navigation simple and logical.
- Different directories like /home, /etc, /bin and /var serve specific system purposes.
- Linux supports multiple file system types like ext4, XFS, Btrfs, each offering different features.
Linux File System Structure
The Linux file system architecture is organized into three important layers, each responsible for different functionalities. These layers work together to provide smooth file access, storage and management.
1. Logical File System
Ensures applications interact with files in a simple and consistent way, without worrying about storage details.
- Acts as the interface between user applications and the file system.
- Handles key operations like open, read, write and close.
- Provides security checks, such as permissions and file access control.
2. Virtual File System (VFS)
Makes file operations uniform and compatible, regardless of the underlying file system format.
- Provides a common interface for different file systems (ext4, XFS, FAT32, NTFS, etc.).
- Allows Linux to use multiple file system types at the same time.
- Acts as an abstraction layer, hiding the internal complexities of each file system.
3. Physical File System
Ensures reliable storage, error handling and low-level data management.
- Directly interacts with the hardware and disk storage.
- Manages data blocks, nodes and physical memory allocation.
- Responsible for writing data to the disk and retrieving it efficiently.
Characteristics of a File System
A file system defines the structure, rules and methods for how data is organized, stored, accessed and managed on a storage device.
- Space Management: Manages block allocation, free-space tracking and fragmentation control to optimize storage efficiency.
- Filename: Enforces naming rules including character sets, length limits and case sensitivity for file identification.
- Directory: Implements hierarchical indexing structures to organize and locate files efficiently.
- Metadata: Stores file attributes such as ownership, permissions, timestamps, size and file type information.
- Utilities: Provides system-level operations for file creation, deletion, backup, recovery and access management.
- Design: Defines architectural limits and mechanisms that determine file system scalability, reliability and performance.
Linux Directory Structure
- Linux directory structure follows a hierarchical, tree-like structure that starts from the root directory (/).
- All files, directories, devices and system resources are organized under the root directory.
- This standardized organization makes it easier to manage, access and maintain files and system resources in Linux.
For a detailed understanding of the Linux directory structure and the purpose of each directory, you can refer to the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS).
Advanced File System Features
1. Journaling
Journaling file systems maintain a special log called a journal that records file system changes before they are permanently written to disk. This helps restore data in case of unexpected shutdowns or crashes.
Working of Journaling
- Changes are first logged in the journal.
- Then they are written to the actual disk.
- Finally, they are marked as completed.
Journaling Modes
Journaling can operate in three different modes, each offering a balance between speed and data safety:
- Journal Mode (Highest Safety): Journals both file data and metadata to provide maximum crash consistency and data integrity.
- Ordered Mode (Balanced): Journals only metadata while enforcing data writes before metadata commits to prevent stale data exposure.
- Writeback Mode (Fastest): Journals only metadata without write-order guarantees, maximizing performance at the cost of crash consistency.
2. Versioning
Versioning file systems keep track of previous versions of a file, allowing users to recover older copies when needed.
- Stores earlier states of files based on commits, time intervals (minute/hour) or system events.
- Useful for backup, history tracking and accidental deletion recovery.
3. Inode
An inode (index node) is a data structure that stores important information about files and directories. Inodes act as the internal identity of files in Linux file systems.
- File size, permissions and ownership details.
- Storage location (pointers to actual data blocks on disk).
File System Implementations
Here are some linux file systems:
Note: Cluster and distributed file systems will not be included for simplicity.
1. ext (Extended File System)
- Introduced in 1992 as the first file system created specifically for Linux.
- Marked the beginning of the ext family, laying the foundation for ext2, ext3 and ext4.
2. ext2
- Developed in 1993 as a non-journaling file system.
- Improved timestamp handling and file attribute management compared to ext.
- Lacks journaling, making boot-time recovery slower after improper shutdowns.
3. Xiafs
- Created in 1993 as an alternative to ext2.
- Had limited features and poor scalability, making it less reliable.
- Eventually discontinued and no longer used in modern systems.
4. ext3
- Introduced in 1999, adding journaling for better reliability and faster crash recovery.
- Supports online file system resizing and uses HTree indexing for large directories.
- Eliminates lengthy boot-time checks that were common with ext2.
5. JFS (Journaled File System)
- Originally developed by IBM in 1990, later open-sourced for Linux.
- Known for stable performance under varying workloads.
- Usage declined after ext4 emerged with better performance and compatibility.
6. ReiserFS
- Introduced in 2001 with advanced features like tail packing to reduce internal fragmentation.
- Uses B+ Trees, enabling fast directory lookups and updates.
- Was default in SUSE Linux (until 6.4) before being replaced by ext3.
7. XFS
- A 64-bit journaling file system ported to Linux in 2001.
- Supports snapshots, sparse files, online defragmentation and large storage capacity.
- Excellent for parallel I/O operations, now default in several Linux distributions.
8. SquashFS
- Introduced in 2002 as a compressed, read-only file system.
- Used mainly in embedded systems where low storage overhead is required.
9. Reiser4
- Developed in 2004 as the successor to ReiserFS.

ext4 in the Linux File System
The ext4 (Fourth Extended File System) was designed with full backward compatibility to ext3 and ext2. It builds upon their strengths while introducing major enhancements in performance, scalability, reliability and storage flexibility.
- Large File System Support: ext4 can handle significantly larger files and volumes compared to its predecessors, making it suitable for modern storage demands.
- Extents for Efficient Storage: It uses extents (continuous physical blocks) instead of block mapping, improving large file performance and reducing fragmentation.
- Persistent Pre-Allocation: Guarantees storage allocation in advance, ensuring contiguous space and consistent performance especially useful for media files and databases.
- Delayed Allocation: ext4 delays block allocation until data is flushed to disk. This improves performance and reduces fragmentation by allocating blocks more efficiently.
- Unlimited Subdirectories (HTree Indexing): Uses HTree-based indexing, enabling the creation of unlimited subdirectories with fast lookup times.
- Journal Checksumming: Adds checksums to the journal, allowing the file system to detect invalid or corrupted entries after a crash, improving reliability.
- Enhanced Timestamps: Includes creation-time stamps and supports nanosecond-level precision for improved granularity.
- Transparent Encryption: Supports filesystem-level encryption, improving data confidentiality without external tools.
- Lazy Initialization: Cleans inode tables in the background, reducing the time required to initialize or expand the file system.
- Default Write Barriers: Ensures proper ordering of metadata writes to protect against corruption during sudden power loss.
- In-Development Features: Some enhancements like metadata checksumming, quota improvements and larger allocation blocks are still being refined for broader stability.
Hands-On Example: Using XFS for a Media Server
Example: Suppose our use case is to set up a server that stores and serves large multimedia files (videos, audio files, etc.). In this scenario, we need a file system optimized for high-speed data transfer and efficient handling of large files.
- The XFS file system is a suitable choice because it is optimized for large files, supports high throughput and performs exceptionally well in media-heavy environments.
Step 1: Install XFS Utilities
Install the required tools for managing the XFS file system:
sudo apt install xfsprogs
Step 2: Create a Partition
Create or choose a partition (e.g., /dev/sda1) where XFS will be applied. You can use tools like fdisk, parted, to create/manage the partition.
Step 3: Format the Partition as XFS
Format the partition using the XFS file system (-f is used to force the formatting and avoid warnings).
sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/sda1 -f
Step 4: Mount the XFS Partition
Mount the formatted XFS partition to a directory:
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/jayesh_xfs_partition
You may create your own mount directory using:
sudo mkdir /mnt/my_xfs_data
Step 5: Verify the Mount
Check whether the XFS partition is mounted successfully:
df -h
- This will confirm the mount point, file system type and usage.
