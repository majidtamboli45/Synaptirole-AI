# Linux command in DevOps

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-unix/linux-command-in-devops/

Linux commands are the foundation of DevOps operations used for system administration, automation and troubleshooting. They help engineers manage files, processes, users, networks and system resources efficiently. These commands are widely used in servers, cloud environments and CI/CD pipelines.
- Manage and control running processes and services
- Automate repetitive tasks using shell scripting
- Debug issues using logs and system monitoring tools
- Enable secure remote server access (e.g., SSH)
- Configure system components like permissions, storage and networks
Basic Commands
1. pwd
The pwd command helps you identify your current location in the file system:
The pwd command is used to display the current working directory.

Creating Files and Directories
In DevOps, creating and managing files and directories is a common task. Here are some essential commands:
For Creating Directories
1. Create a Single Directory
Command:
mkdir GFG
2. Create Multiple Directories
Command:
mkdir GFG1 GFG2 GFG3
3. Create Nested Directories (directories inside directories)
Command:
mkdir -p /GFG/GFG1/GFG2
4. For creating a series of numbered directories
Command:
mkdir gfg{1..3}
For Creating Files
We can create file in linux by using various commands like vi, touch, echo, nano etc. The following table will explain the use case of each command:
| Command | Purpose | Example | 
|---|---|---|
| touch | Creates an empty file | touch file.txt | 
| echo | Creates a file with content | echo "Hello" > hello.txt | 
| cat | Creates/writes to a file via input | cat > notes.txt (Ctrl + D to save) | 
| nano | Opens a simple terminal editor | nano file.txt | 
| vi / vim | Opens a powerful terminal editor | vi file.txt | 
Copying and Pasting Files and Directories
The cp command is used in Linux to copy files and directories. Below are common options and examples
Command (verbose, recursive, force overwrite):
cp -rvf gfg1 gfg
Removing Files and Directories
In Linux (and DevOps environments), the rm command is used to delete files and directories. Use it carefully, as deletion is permanent.
- For removing a directory and its contents
Command:
rm -rvf gfg
Renaming Files and Directories
The mv command in Linux is used to rename files or directories (and also to move them).
Command:
mv gfg gfg-devop
User Management
User management in Linux is a crucial aspect of DevOps and system administration. Managing users and their permissions ensures that your systems are secure, organized and meet the needs of your organization. Heres an overview of user management in Linux within a DevOps context:
1. Creating a User
To create a new user in Linux, you can use the useradd command. For example:
Syntax:
sudo useradd [username]
2. Setting a Password
After creating a user, set a password using the passwd command:
Syntax:
sudo passwd [username]
3. Deleting a User
To delete a user, use the userdel command:
Command:
sudo userdel [username]
4. Switch to Another User
The su command allows you to switch to another users account by providing the username as an argument. To exit from the users account and return to your original session, you can simply type exit.
Syntax:
su [USER NAME]
5. Rename the User
To change the username from the current name (oldname) to the new name (newname), use the following command.
Command:
sudo usermod -l [newname] [oldname]
Group Management
A group is a collection of user accounts that is very useful to administrators for managing and applying permission to a number users.
| Command | Description | 
|---|---|
| sudo groupadd <groupname> | Creates a new group | 
| sudo groupdel <groupname> | Deletes an existing group | 
| sudo usermod -g <groupname> <username> | Adds/assigns a user to a group | 
Process Management
A process management is the process of controlling and monitoring the process running on a Linux system.
1. ps
ps command displays currently running processes.
Command:
ps aux
2. top
The top command is used for memory monitoring. It shows a real-time view of system processes.
Command:
top
3. kill
The kill command is used to terminate a process using its PID.
Command:
kill 1234
4. pidof
The pidof command is used to gets the PID of a running process by name.
Command:
pidof bash
5. systemctl
The systemctl command is used to start/stop/restart systemd-managed services (like Docker, Nginx etc.)
Command:
sudo systemctl status nginx
Linux File System Permission
In Linux, file and directory permissions are used to improve system security.
There are three main types of permissions:
- Read (r): View file contents
- Write (w): Modify file contents
- Execute (x): Run a file or access a directory
Permissions are assigned to three categories of users:
- User (u): Owner of the file
- Group (g): Users who are part of the file’s group
- Others (o): All other users
Example:
If a file has read permission only for the user, then:
- The user can read the file
- The group cannot access it
- others cannot access it either
1. ls -ld
It is used to check the permission of directory
Command:
 ls -ld
Permission with numeric & symbol
| Number | Permission Type | Symbol | 
|---|---|---|
| 0 | No permission | --- | 
| 1 | Execute | --x | 
| 2 | Write | -w- | 
| 3 | Write + Execute | -wx | 
| 4 | Read | r-- | 
| 5 | Read + Execute | r-x | 
| 6 | Read + Write | rw- | 
| 7 | Read + Write + Execute | rwx | 
2. chmod (Change Mode)
This command is used to change the permission of file and directory.
Syntax:
chmod [permissions] filename
3. chown (Change Owner)
It is used to change the owner of the file and directory.
Syntax:
chown [owner_name] [file name]
4. cat
It is used to read and concatenate the text inside the files. with help of this command we can displays the content inside the file.
Syntax:
cat <flag> {filename}
| Command | Description | 
|---|---|
| cat -b | This flag adds number to the text line. | 
| cat -E | This flag add $ at the end of each line. | 
5. Grep (Global Regular Expression Print)
It filter and searches a file for a particular pattern of characters and displays all lines that contain the pattern.
Command:
grep <flag or search_word> {file name}
| Command | Description | 
|---|---|
| grep -i | Delivers results for case-insensitive strings. | 
| grep -n | Retrieve the corresponding strings and their respective line numbers. | 
| grep -v | Provides the output of lines that do not contain the search string. |

sort filename
