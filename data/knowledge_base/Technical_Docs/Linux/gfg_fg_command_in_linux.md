# fg command in Linux

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-unix/fg-command-in-linux-with-examples/

The fg command in Linux is used to bring a background job to the foreground. It allows you to interact with the process directly through the terminal.
- Resumes a background or stopped job in the foreground.
- Useful for switching back to a process that was sent to the background with bg or &.
Example:
Command:
sleep 60 &
fg %3
Output:
- sleep 60 &: starts the process in the background with job ID [3]
- fg %3: brings job 3 to the foreground and continues its execution
Syntax
fg [job_spec]
The job_spec is a way to refer to the background jobs that are currently running or suspended.
- %n: Refers to job number n.
- %str: Refers to a job that was started by a command beginning with str.
- %?str: Refers to a job that was started by a command containing str.
- %% or %+: Refers to the current job (this is the default job operated on by fg if no job_spec is provided).
- %-: Refers to the previous job.
Key Options for the fg command
1. fg [JOB_SPEC]:

Command:
jobs
sleep 500
# Press: Ctrl + Z
jobs
bg %1
jobs
