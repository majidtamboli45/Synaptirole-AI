Methods to Install Atom on Linux
1. Install Using Snap (Easy Method)
Snap packages bundle the application along with all required dependencies. This makes installation simple but can increase package size and startup time. Snap packages work on most major Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Debian, Fedora and Kali Linux.
Install Command:
sudo snap install atom --classic
Output:
Note: Snap is easy to use and manage, but it may not offer the best performance compared to native packages.
2. Install Using .deb or .rpm Package (Recommended Method)
Atom can be installed using .deb or .rpm packages depending on the Linux distribution. This method provides better system integration and performance.
- Debian-based systems (Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Kali Linux) use .deb packages.
- Fedora and similar distributions use .rpm packages.
Steps:
- Download the appropriate package from the official Atom website.
- Double-click the downloaded file. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
Note: These packages are available only for 64-bit systems. Make sure your OS is 64-bit before downloading.
3. Install Using PPA (For 32-bit Debian-Based Systems)
For 32-bit Debian Linux users, they can install atom via PPA. PPA is Personal Package Archive which allows developers to create the repository and distribute the software.
- This method allows 32-bit users to install Atom through a maintained repository.
Installation Commands:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/atom
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install atom
Output:
4. Install Using Ubuntu Software Center
