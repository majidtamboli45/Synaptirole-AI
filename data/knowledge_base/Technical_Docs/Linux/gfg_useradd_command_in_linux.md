Creating user accounts is a fundamental responsibility of a Linux system administrator, enabling secure access control and proper permission management. Linux provides powerful tools to create and manage users efficiently, especially in multi-user and server environments.
- Provide system access to new users such as developers or team members.
- Create service accounts for applications like web servers or databases.
- Isolate tasks and improve system security through permission separation.
- Manage system resources by assigning users specific roles.
Let us consider a command to add a user named test_user to the system. This command creates a new user account without additional customization.
Command:
sudo useradd test_user

Files Modified by useradd
When you run useradd, it's the command edits a set of system files to register the new user.
- /etc/passwd: Stores user information like the username, UID, GID, home directory path, and default shell.
- /etc/shadow: Stores the user's encrypted password. This is why useradd alone can't set a password.
- /etc/group: Stores information about user groups.
- /etc/gshadow: Stores secure information for groups.
- /home/[username]: (If created) This is the user's personal directory. The initial files in it are copied from /etc/skel.
adduser vs useradd
- adduser is an interactive, user-friendly tool commonly used on Debian/Ubuntu systems. It creates the user, home directory, password, and prompts for additional details.
- useradd is a low-level, non-interactive command designed for scripting and automation, commonly used on RHEL, CentOS, and Fedora systems.
