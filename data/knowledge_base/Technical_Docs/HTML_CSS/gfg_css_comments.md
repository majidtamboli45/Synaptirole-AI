# CSS Comments

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css/css-comments

CSS comments are used to add notes or explanations to your code, helping you and others understand it better.
- Comments can be added anywhere in the code, and they can span across multiple lines.
- It’s a good practice to add comments to clarify complex parts of your code for future reference or collaboration.
- Older methods like <!-- --> for hiding CSS in older browsers are outdated and not recommended.
- Comments are simply ignored by the browser, so they don't affect the output in any way.

CSS comments are universally supported across all modern browsers and platforms. Since they are ignored by the browser, they do not affect the visual layout or functionality of the web page. No special handling or cross-browser testing is required for comments.
