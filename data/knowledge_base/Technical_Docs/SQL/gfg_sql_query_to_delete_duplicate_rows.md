# SQL Query to Delete Duplicate Rows

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql/sql-query-to-delete-duplicate-rows/

Duplicate rows in a database can cause inconsistent results and affect performance. Removing them helps maintain data accuracy and efficiency.
- Caused by import errors or missing constraints.
- Lead to wasted storage and slower queries.
- Can be removed using SQL functions like ROW_NUMBER() or COUNT().
Example: First, we will create a demo SQL table, on which we will use the Delete Duplicate Rows command.
Query:
DELETE FROM customer
WHERE customer_id NOT IN (
SELECT MIN(customer_id)
FROM customer
GROUP BY first_name, country
);
SELECT * FROM customer;
Output:
Identify Duplicate Rows
We use the GROUP BY clause with the COUNT(*) function to identify duplicate values.
Query:
SELECT first_name, country, COUNT(*) AS duplicate_countFROM customerGROUP BY first_name, countryHAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
Output:
- GROUP BY first_name,country: Groups customers with the same name and country.
- COUNT(*): Counts the number of rows in each group.
- HAVING COUNT(*) > 1: Shows groups that contain duplicate records.
- Result: Displays the duplicated first_name and country combinations.
Methods to Delete Duplicate Rows in SQL
There are several ways to remove duplicate rows from a table.
Using GROUP BY and MIN()
This method keeps the row with the smallest CustomerID for each duplicate group and removes the remaining rows.
Query:
DELETE FROM customerWHERE customer_id NOT IN (    SELECT MIN(customer_id)    FROM customer    GROUP BY first_name, country);SELECT * FROM customer;
Output:
Using ROW_NUMBER()
The ROW_NUMBER() function assigns a unique number to each row within a group. Rows with a number greater than 1 are duplicates and can be deleted.
Query:
WITH duplicate_rows AS (    SELECT customer_id,           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (               PARTITION BY first_name, country               ORDER BY customer_id           ) AS row_num    FROM customer)DELETE FROM customerWHERE customer_id IN (    SELECT customer_id    FROM duplicate_rows    WHERE row_num > 1);SELECT * FROM customer;
Output:
Using Common Table Expression (CTE)
A CTE can be used to identify duplicate rows and delete them in a structured way.
Query:
WITH duplicate_rows AS (    SELECT customer_id,           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (               PARTITION BY first_name, country               ORDER BY customer_id           ) AS row_num    FROM customer)DELETE FROM customerWHERE customer_id IN (    SELECT customer_id    FROM duplicate_rows    WHERE row_num > 1);SELECT * FROM customer;
Output:
Using a Temporary Table
A temporary table can store unique records before replacing the duplicate data in the original table.
Query:
DROP TEMPORARY TABLE IF EXISTS unique_customers;CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE unique_customers ASSELECT *FROM customerWHERE customer_id IN (    SELECT MIN(customer_id)    FROM customer    GROUP BY first_name, country);DELETE FROM customer;INSERT INTO customerSELECT *FROM unique_customers;DROP TEMPORARY TABLE unique_customers;SELECT * FROM customer;
Output:
Using DISTINCT with INSERT INTO
The DISTINCT keyword can be used to select unique customer records before inserting them back into the table.
Query:
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE unique_customers ASSELECT DISTINCT first_name, countryFROM customer;DELETE FROM customer;INSERT INTO customer (first_name, country)SELECT first_name, countryFROM unique_customers;DROP TEMPORARY TABLE unique_customers;SELECT * FROM customer;
Output:
Why You Should Remove Duplicate Rows
- Data Integrity: Prevents duplicate records from affecting results.
- Better Performance: Reduces unnecessary data and improves query efficiency.
- Efficient Storage: Removes redundant records and saves storage space.
