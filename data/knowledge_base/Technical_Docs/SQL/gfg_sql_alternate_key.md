# SQL ALTERNATE KEY

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql/sql-alternate-key/

An Alternate Key is a candidate key that is not chosen as the Primary Key but can still uniquely identify a record in a table.
- When multiple attributes can uniquely identify records, only one is selected as the Primary Key.
- The remaining unique attributes act as Alternate Keys, providing alternative ways to identify records.
Query:
CREATE TABLE customer_info (
customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
customer_name VARCHAR(50),
email_address VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
pan_number VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE,
city VARCHAR(50)
);
INSERT INTO customer_info
VALUES
(1, 'James Carter', 'james.carter@example.com', 'PANA12345Z', 'New York'),
(2, 'Emily Watson', 'emily.watson@example.com', 'PANB67890Q', 'Los Angeles');
Output:
- email_address and pan_number act as Alternate Keys (unique but not the Primary Key).
- Both rows follow the uniqueness rules.
Syntax
The ALTERNATE Keys in SQL are defined using the SQL constraint UNIQUE:
CREATE TABLE customer_info (
column_1 datatype PRIMARY KEY, -- Primary Key
column_2 datatype ,
column_3 datatype UNIQUE, -- Alternate Key
column_4 datatype UNIQUE, -- Alternate Key
. . . ,
);
Note: A candidate key should be a column that can uniquely identify any row in a table and any of them are eligible to be selected as the Primary Key.
Creating an Alternate Key in SQL
An Alternate Key in SQL is created using the UNIQUE constraint to enforce uniqueness on a column.
Query:
CREATE TABLE product (
product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
product_name VARCHAR(50),
product_code VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE
);
CREATE TABLE orders (
order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
order_number VARCHAR(30) UNIQUE,
product_id INT,
quantity INT,
FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES product(product_id)
);
INSERT INTO product
VALUES
(101, 'Wireless Mouse', 'WMX-100'),
(102, 'Bluetooth Speaker', 'BTS-250');
INSERT INTO orders
VALUES
(1, 'ORD-9001', 101, 2),
(2, 'ORD-9002', 102, 1);
Output:
product table:
orders table:
- product_id is the Primary Key in Product, while product_code is UNIQUE, making it the Alternate Key.
- order_id is the Primary Key in Orders and product_id functions as a Foreign Key referencing Product.
- order_number is UNIQUE, so it serves as the Alternate Key in the Orders table.
Primary Key vs. Alternate Key
Here are the detailed comparison between Primary and Alternate key:
| Primary Key | Alternate Key | 
|---|---|
| Must be unique | Must be unique | 
| Cannot contain NULL values | Can contain NULL values | 
| Used to identify each row uniquely | An alternate option for uniqueness | 
| The selected candidate key | Other candidate keys not selected as primary | 
| One primary key per table | Multiple alternate keys possible |
