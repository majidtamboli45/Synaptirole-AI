# SQL NOT Operator

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql/sql-not-operator/

The SQL NOT operator is used to reverse the boolean result of a condition in SQL. It helps in retrieving records that do not match a specific condition. It is mostly used to specify what should not be included in the results table.
Example: First, we create a demo SQL database and table, on which we will use the NOT Operator command.
Query:
SELECT customer_name, last_name
FROM customer
WHERE NOT last_name = 'Tanaka';
Output:
Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, … 
FROM table_name WHERE NOT condition; Examples
Let's understand NOT in SQL with examples. First, we will create a demo SQL database and table, on which we will use the NOT command.
Example 1: Using SQL NOT to Exclude a Specific Value
The following SQL statement selects all fields from customers table where the country is not UK.
Query:
SELECT * 
FROM customers
WHERE NOT country = 'UK';
Output:
Example 2: Using SQL NOT with IN Operator
The NOT operator can also be used with the IN condition to exclude multiple values from the result set.
Query:
SELECT * 
FROM customers
WHERE NOT country IN ('USA', 'UK');
Output:
- Here, the NOT with IN condition filters out customers from both the USA and UK and returns only customers from other countries.
Example 3: Using SQL NOT with LIKE Operator
We can also combine NOT with the LIKE operator to exclude records that match a certain pattern.
Query:
SELECT * 
FROM customers
WHERE NOT customer_name LIKE 'M%';
Output:
- In this query, the NOT LIKE condition filters out customers whose name starts with the letter 'M', returning all others.
Example 4: Using SQL NOT with NULL Values
To exclude records where a column has a NULL value, combine NOT with the IS NULL condition.
Query:
SELECT * 
FROM customers
WHERE NOT postal_code IS NULL;
Output:
- This query excludes customers who have a NULL value for postal_code.
Example 5: Using NOT with AND Operator
This query retrieves customers who are not from the USA and are also not from the UK.
Query:
SELECT * 
FROM customers
WHERE NOT country = 'USA' AND NOT country = 'UK';
Output:
