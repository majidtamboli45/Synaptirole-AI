# SQL CREATE TABLE

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql/sql-create-table/

The CREATE TABLE statement in SQL is used to define a new table in a database. It specifies the table structure including column names and their data types.
- Used to create a new table in a database.
- Defines column names and their data types.
- Helps in organizing and storing data systematically
Syntax
CREATE TABLE table_name
(
column1 datatype (size),
column2 datatype (size),
.
.
columnN datatype(size)
);
- table_name: The name you assign to the new table.
- column1, column2, ... : The names of the columns in the table.
- datatype(size): Defines the data type and size of each column.
Working
Query
CREATE TABLE customer(
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    country VARCHAR(50),
    age INT CHECK (age >= 0 AND age <= 99),
    phone INT(10)
);
Output:
Inserting Data into the Table
After creating the table, you can use INSERT INTO command to add data into it. Here is how to add some sample records into the customer table:
INSERT INTO customer (customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, age, phone)
VALUES
(1, 'Luca', 'Bianchi', 'Italy', 23, 'xxxxxxxxxx'),
(2, 'Aiko', 'Tanaka', 'Japan', 21, 'xxxxxxxxxx'),
(3, 'Carlos', 'Gomez', 'Spain', 24, 'xxxxxxxxxx'),
(4, 'Sofia', 'Müller', 'Germany', 22, 'xxxxxxxxxx'),
(5, 'Ethan', 'Johnson', 'USA', 25, 'xxxxxxxxxx');
Output:
Note: If you are working with a large amount of data, consider using bulk inserts or importing data from external files to optimize performance.
Create Table from Existing Table
The CREATE TABLE AS SELECT statement creates a new table using selected columns and data from an existing table.
Syntax
CREATE TABLE new_table_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM existing_table_name;
Example
CREATE TABLE customer_subset AS
SELECT customer_id, first_name
FROM customer;
Output:
Note: We can use * instead of column name to copy whole table to another table.
Tips for Using CREATE TABLE
To ensure the smooth creation and management of your tables, keep these points in mind:
1. The CREATE TABLE statement can also define constraints like NOT NULL, UNIQUE and DEFAULT.
2. If you attempt to create a table that already exists, SQL will throw an error. To avoid this, you can use the IF NOT EXISTS clause.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS customer (...);
3. Always define appropriate data types for each column (e.g., VARCHAR(50) for names and INT for IDs) to optimize performance and storage.
4. After creating a table, use the following command to view the structure of your table:
DESC table_name;
5. If you need to change the table’s structure after creation (e.g., renaming a column, adding a new column), use the ALTER TABLE statement.
