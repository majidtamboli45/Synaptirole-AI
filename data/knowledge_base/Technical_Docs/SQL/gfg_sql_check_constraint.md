# SQL CHECK Constraint

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql/sql-check-constraint/

The CHECK constraint in SQL ensures that only valid data enters a column by enforcing specific conditions. If a value doesn’t satisfy the defined rule, the insert or update operation is blocked.
- Can be defined while creating a table or added later using ALTER TABLE.
- Works with other constraints like PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY and NOT NULL.
- Can check multiple columns at once as a row-level condition.
Query:
CREATE TABLE staff (
staff_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
full_name VARCHAR(50),
salary DECIMAL(10, 2) CHECK (salary > 0 AND salary <= 50000)
);
-- These inserts will succeed
INSERT INTO staff (staff_id, full_name, salary)
VALUES
(1, 'Taylor Reed', 45000),
(2, 'John Doe', 42000);
Output:
- The CHECK constraint ensures salary values are positive and ≤ 50,000.
- Both inserted records follow this rule, so the insert succeeds.
Query:
INSERT INTO staff (staff_id, full_name, salary) VALUES 
(3, 'Jordan Miles', -3000),
(4, 'Evan Clarke', 62000);
Error:
- Both salaries violate the CHECK rule: one is negative and the other exceeds 50,000.
- Because the values break the condition, the entire INSERT operation is rejected.
Syntax
1. Using CHECK with CREATE TABLE:
CREATE TABLE table_name (
column1 datatype,
column2 datatype CHECK (condition),
...
);
2. Using CHECK with ALTER TABLE:
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD CONSTRAINT constraint_name CHECK (condition);
Examples
Let’s look at some practical examples to better understand how the CHECK constraint works in SQL.
Example 1: Applying CHECK on a Single Column
In this example, the customers table restricts age to 18 to 120 and the CHECK constraint blocks any value outside this range.
Query:
CREATE TABLE customers (
customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(50),
age INT CHECK (age >= 18 AND age <= 120)
);
-- Valid insert
INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, name, age)
VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 25);
-- Invalid insert
INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, name, age)
VALUES (2, 'Jane Smith', 15); -- This will fail due to the CHECK constraint
Output:
- The CHECK constraint ensures age must be between 18 and 120.
- Only values within this range can be inserted into the table.
Error:
- The age value 15 violates the CHECK condition.
- Because it falls outside the allowed range, the insert operation fails.
Example 2: CHECK Constraint with Multiple Columns
In this example, the CHECK constraint can also validate multiple columns, such as ensuring salary is positive and age is at least 18 in an employee table.
Query:
CREATE TABLE employee (
employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(50),
age INT,
salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
CHECK (age >= 18 AND salary > 0)
);
-- Valid insert
INSERT INTO employee (employee_id, name, age, salary) VALUES
(1, 'Alice Johnson', 30, 50000),
(2, 'Bob Lee', 27, 47000);
-- Invalid insert (age < 18)
INSERT INTO employee (employee_id, name, age, salary)
VALUES (3, 'Bob Lee', 16, 45000); -- This will fail due to the CHECK constraint
Output:
- The CHECK condition requires age to be at least 18 and salary to be positive.
- Both conditions must be true for any row inserted into the employee table.
Error:
- The age value 16 violates the CHECK requirement (must be ≥ 18).
- Because the condition fails, the insert operation is rejected.
Example 3: Adding a CHECK Constraint with ALTER TABLE
We can add a CHECK constraint to an existing table using the ALTER TABLE statement.
Query:
ALTER TABLE employee
ADD CONSTRAINT chk_salary CHECK (salary >= 30000);
- The chk_salary CHECK constraint ensures salary must be at least 30,000.
- Any insert or update with a salary below this value is rejected.
