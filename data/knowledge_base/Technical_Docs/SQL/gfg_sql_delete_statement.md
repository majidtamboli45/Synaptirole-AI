# SQL DELETE Statement

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql/sql-delete-statement/

The SQL DELETE statement is used to remove specific rows from a table while keeping the table structure intact. It is different from DROP, which deletes the entire table.
- Removes rows based on conditions.
- Retains table schema, constraints and indexes.
- Can delete a single row or all rows.
Example: First, we create a demo SQL database and table, on which we will use the SQL DELETE command.
Query:
DELETE FROM employee
WHERE employee_id = 5;
Output:
- This query deletes the row from the employees table where the employee_id is 5.
- Only that specific record is removed; all other rows remain unchanged.
Syntax
DELETE FROM table_name 
WHERE some_condition;
- Some_condition: A condition used to filter the rows you want to delete.
- table_name: The name of the table from which you want to delete the rows.
Note: We can delete single or multiple records using the WHERE clause; if it’s omitted, all records in the table are removed.
Working with the DELETE Statement
Consider the employee table in SQL, which stores employee details such as id, name, email and department, as shown below.
Example 1: Deleting Single Record
We can use the DELETE statement with a condition to delete one or more rows that match the given condition a table. The WHERE clause ensures only the intended record is removed. We can delete the records named Ethan by using the below query:
Query:
DELETE FROM employees 
WHERE name = 'Ethan';
SELECT * FROM employees;
Output:
Example 2: Deleting Multiple Records
To delete multiple records, you can specify a condition that matches several rows. Let's delete the rows from the table employees where the department is "Development".
Query:
DELETE FROM employees 
WHERE department = 'Development';
SELECT * FROM employees;
Output
Example 3: Delete All Records from a Table
To delete all records from a table, omit the WHERE clause in the DELETE statement. The use of an asterisk (*) with DELETE is invalid in SQL.
Query:
DELETE FROM employees;
Output:
- All of the records in the table will be deleted, there are no records left to display. The table employees will become empty.
Rolling Back DELETE Operations
Since the DELETE statement is a DML operation, it can be rolled back when executed in a statement. If you accidentally delete records or need to repeat the process, you can use the ROLLBACK command.
Query:
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Development';
ROLLBACK;
- The ROLLBACK command will undo the changes made by the DELETE statement, effectively restoring the records that were deleted during the transaction.
