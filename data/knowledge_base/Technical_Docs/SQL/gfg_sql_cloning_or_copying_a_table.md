# SQL Cloning or Copying a Table

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql/sql-cloning-or-copying-a-table/

Cloning or copying a table in SQL is used to create a duplicate of an existing table for various purposes.
- Helps create backup copies of important data.
- Allows testing and analysis without affecting the original table.
Example: First, we will create a demo SQL database and table, on which we will use the Cloning command.
Query:
CREATE TABLE employee_copy
AS
SELECT * 
FROM employee;
Output:
Methods for Cloning Tables in SQL
There are three different methods to create a clone table in SQL:
- Simple Cloning
- Deep Cloning
- Shallow Cloning
Step 1: Create the Original Table
The following student table is used to demonstrate table cloning, with sample records added for illustration.
Simple Cloning
In this method, the clone table creates a copy of the original table’s structure and data, but constraints like primary keys, unique keys and auto-increment properties are not preserved.
Syntax
CREATE TABLE clone_table 
SELECT * FROM original_table;
Example: Let us see the example to understand how simple cloning syntax works.
Query
CREATE TABLE student_copy AS
SELECT * FROM student;
SELECT * FROM student_copy;
Output:
- Original student table: student_id is PRIMARY KEY and AUTO_INCREMENT
- roll_no is UNIQUE in the original table
- Cloned table student_copy does not retain constraints
- It only copies structure and data, without primary key, auto-increment or unique key
Drawback Of Simple Cloning
Simple SQL cloning may not preserve unique constraints and auto-increment settings, which can affect data integrity. Reapply them manually after cloning if needed.
Query:
INSERT INTO  student_copy VALUES
(0, 'Noah Anderson', 'S400'),
(0, 'Emma Johnson', 'S500');
Output:
- In the original table student, the column student_id was set as the primary key.
- In , student_copy the last two entries have duplicate values.
- AUTO_INCREMENT doesn’t work in the cloned table.
- Using Shallow Cloning can prevent these issues.
Shallow Cloning
Shallow cloning creates a new table with the same structure as the original table but without copying any data. It preserves constraints such as primary keys, unique keys, indexes and auto-increment settings.
Syntax
CREATE TABLE clone_table  
LIKE original_table;
Query
CREATE TABLE student_shallow_clone LIKE student;
SELECT * FROM student_shallow_clone;
Insert Data into Shallow Clone
INSERT INTO student_shallow_clone(name, roll_no)
VALUES ('Ethan Miller', 'S100');
INSERT INTO student_shallow_clone(name, roll_no)
VALUES ('Olivia Brown', 'S200');
INSERT INTO student_shallow_clone (name, roll_no)
VALUES ('Liam Wilson', 'S300');
Output:
- This cloning method copies the table structure and may include indexes and AUTO_INCREMENT
- It does not copy all properties (like triggers, foreign keys, permissions, metadata)
- The cloned table does not work exactly like the original
Deep Cloning
Deep cloning creates a copy of a table along with all its data, preserving both the structure and records of the original table.
Syntax
CREATE TABLE clone_table LIKE original_table;
INSERT INTO clone_table
SELECT *
FROM original_table;
Query
CREATE TABLE student_deep_clone LIKE student;
INSERT INTO student_deep_clone
SELECT *
FROM student;
SELECT *
FROM student_deep_clone;
Output:
The output of the "student_deep_clone" is exactly the same as the "student" table. We can add new entries to the deep clone table to confirm the preservation of constraints:
INSERT INTO student_deep_clone (name, roll_no)
VALUES ('Emma Johnson', 'S400');
INSERT INTO student_deep_clone (name, roll_no)
VALUES ('Sophia Davis', 'S500');
SELECT *
FROM student_deep_clone;
Output:
- This cloning method preserves all table properties.
- Indexes and AUTO_INCREMENT are copied from the original table.
- The cloned table works like the original with the same structure and constraints.
