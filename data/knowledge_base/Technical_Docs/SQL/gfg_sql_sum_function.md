# SQL SUM() Function

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql/sql-sum-function/

The SQL SUM() function is an aggregate function used to calculate the total value of a numeric column. It is widely used in reporting, financial calculations, and data analysis to quickly get overall totals.
- Returns a single total of selected numeric values.
- Works with WHERE, GROUP BY, and HAVING for conditional sums.
- Supports expressions and DISTINCT to sum unique values only.
Example: First, we create a demo SQL database and table, on which we use the SUM() functions.
Query:
SELECT SUM(Amount) AS TotalAmount
FROM Orders;
Output:
- SUM(Amount) calculates the total of all values present in the Amount column.
- The query returns one result named TotalAmount from the Orders table.
Syntax:
SELECT SUM(column_name)
FROM table_name;
Examples of SQL SUM() Function
In this section, we demonstrate the SUM() function using a Sales table (Product, Quantity, Price) to understand how it calculates totals and distinct sums; consider this Sales table for the below examples:
Example 1: Using SUM() with One Column
In this example, SUM() calculates the total of a single numeric column.
Query:
SELECT SUM(Price) AS TotalPrice
FROM Sales;
Output:
- Adds all values in the Price column.
- Returns the result as TotalPrice.
Example 2: Using SUM() with an Expression
In this example, calculates total revenue by multiplying quantity and price.
Query:
SELECT SUM(Quantity * Price) AS TotalRevenue
FROM Sales;
Output:
- Multiplies Quantity × Price for each row.
- Returns the total revenue as TotalRevenue.
Example 3: Using SUM() with GROUP BY
In this example, SUM() is used along with GROUP BY clause. It calculates revenue separately for each product.
Query:
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity * Price) AS TotalRevenue
FROM Sales
GROUP BY Product;
Output:
- Calculates revenue for each product.
- Groups rows by Product before summing.
Example 4: Using SUM() with DISTINCT
In this example, SUM() is used with the DISTINCT keyword to sum only unique price values.
Query:
SELECT SUM(DISTINCT Price) AS SumDistinctPrice
FROM Sales;
Output:
- Adds only unique Price values.
- Returns the result as SumDistinctPrice.
Example 5: Using SUM() with HAVING
The HAVING clause can be used with GROUP BY to filter groups based on the result of the SUM() function, allowing conditions on aggregated data.
Query:
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity * Price) AS TotalRevenue
FROM Sales
GROUP BY Product
HAVING SUM(Quantity * Price) > 2000;
Output:
- Filters products after grouping.
- Shows only products with revenue greater than 2000.
