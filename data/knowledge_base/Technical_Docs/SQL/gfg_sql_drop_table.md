# SQL DROP TABLE

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql/sql-drop-table-statement/

The DROP TABLE command permanently removes a table from the database.
- Deletes all rows and dependent objects, including indexes, constraints and triggers.
- Recovery is possible only through a backup or database recovery mechanism.
Syntax
DROP TABLE table_name;
The following example demonstrates how to use the DROP TABLE command.
Step 1: Create a Database and Table
First, we will create a database and table on which the SQL queries will be run.
CREATE DATABASE new_cafe;
USE new_cafe;
CREATE TABLE categories (
category_id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
category_name NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
item_description NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);
INSERT INTO categories (category_id, category_name, item_description)
VALUES
(1, 'Beverages', 'Soft Drinks'),
(2, 'Condiments', 'Sweet and Savory Sauces'),
(3, 'Confections', 'Sweet Breads');
SELECT * FROM categories;
Output:
At this point, the categories table has been created with three rows of sample data.
Step 2: Drop the Table
Now, let’s use the DROP TABLE statement to delete the categories table permanently
Query:
DROP TABLE categories;
Output:
Working of SQL DROP TABLE
The DROP TABLE statement permanently removes a table from the database along with all its associated data and objects.
- Deletes the table, including its data, indexes, triggers, constraints and permissions.
- Once a table is dropped, it cannot be recovered, so this command should be used with caution.
- Using DROP TABLE IF EXISTS prevents errors by ensuring the table is dropped only if it exists.
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS categories;
- When a partitioned table is dropped, the table definition, all partitions, their data and partition metadata are removed. The partitioning scheme is also deleted if it is not used by other tables.
- Temporary tables can be dropped using the TEMPORARY keyword.
DROP TEMPORARY TABLE temp_table_name;
- To verify whether a table has been dropped, use commands like SHOW TABLES (MySQL) or query INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES. If the table no longer exists, DESCRIBE or DESC will return an error.
SHOW TABLES;
