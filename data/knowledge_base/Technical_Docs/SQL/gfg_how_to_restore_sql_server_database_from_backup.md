A Database is defined as a structured form of data that is stored database a computer or data in an organized manner and can be accessed in various ways. It is also the collection of schemas, tables, queries, views, etc. Databases help us with easily storing, accessing, and manipulating data held on a computer. The Database Management System allows a user to interact with the database. In this article, we will see how can we restore SQL Server Database from Backup.
For the demonstration purpose, we will create one database named 'geeks'.
Step 1: Create Database
Use the below SQL statement to create database called geeks;
QUERY:
CREATE DATABASE geeks;
you can see database with name 'geeks' is created.
Step 2: Use database
Query:
USE geeks;
Step 3: Table definition
We have the following demo_table in the database.
Query:
CREATE TABLE demo_table
(FIRSTNAME varchar(20),
LASTNAME varchar(20),
GENDER varchar(10), AGE int);
Step 4: Insert values
Following command is used to insert values into the table.
Query:
INSERT INTO demo_table VALUES
('ROMY','KUMARI','FEMALE', 22),
('PUSHKAR', 'JHA', 'MALE', 23),
('SOUMYA', 'SHRIYA', 'FEMALE', 22),
('NIKHIL', 'KALRA', 'MALE', 23),
('ROHIT', 'KUMAR', 'MALE', 23),
Step 5: View data of the table
Query:
SELECT * FROM demo_table;
Output:
Restoring of database can be done through Object explorer in SQL Server.

Now, for demonstration of restoring the database. Delete the geeks database.

Syntax:
DROP DATABASE database_name;
We can not drop the database while in use.
Query:
DROP DATABASE geeks;
Output:
geeks database is deleted. You can not find geeks database in the object explorer.
Step 7: Restore database
- Right click on database and select 'Restore database' option
