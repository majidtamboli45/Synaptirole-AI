# SQL CROSS JOIN

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql/sql-cross-join/

SQL CROSS JOIN combines every row from one table with every row from another table. It produces a Cartesian product, meaning each row of the first table is paired with every row of the second table.
- Does not require a join condition.
- If one table has m rows and the other has n rows, the result contains m × n rows.
Syntax
SELECT * FROM table1
CROSS JOIN table2;
Examples
Before diving into queries, let’s create two sample tables: Customer and Orders. These tables will help us understand how CROSS JOIN combines data into multiple combinations.
customer table:
orders table:
Query:
SELECT * 
FROM customer
CROSS JOIN orders;
Output:
- Combines every row from both tables.
- With 2 rows in each table, it returns 2 × 2 = 4 rows.
