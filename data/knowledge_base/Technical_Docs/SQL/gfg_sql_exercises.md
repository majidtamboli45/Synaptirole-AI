Firstly, let us create a sales and products Table.
1. Products Table
The products table contains details about products, including their names, categories and unit prices. It provides reference data for linking product information to sales transactions.
Query:
CREATE TABLE products (
product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
product_name VARCHAR(100),
category VARCHAR(50),
unit_price DECIMAL(10, 2)
);
INSERT INTO products (product_id, product_name, category, unit_price)
VALUES
(101, 'Laptop', 'Electronics', 500.00),
(102, 'Smartphone', 'Electronics', 300.00),
(103, 'Headphones', 'Electronics', 30.00),
(104, 'Keyboard', 'Electronics', 20.00),
(105, 'Mouse', 'Electronics', 15.00);
Output:
2. Sales Table
The sales table records information about product sales, including the quantity sold, sale date and total price for each sale. It serves as a transactional data source for analyzing sales trends.
Query:
CREATE TABLE sales (
sale_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
product_id INT,
quantity_sold INT,
sale_date DATE,
total_price DECIMAL(10, 2),
FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)
);
INSERT INTO sales (sale_id, product_id, quantity_sold, sale_date, total_price) VALUES
(1, 101, 5, '2024-01-01', 2500.00),
(2, 102, 3, '2024-01-02', 900.00),
(3, 103, 2, '2024-01-02', 60.00),

CREATE INDEX idx_sale_date ON sales (sale_date);
-- Query with indexing
SELECT *
FROM sales
WHERE sale_date = '2024-01-03';
Output:
Explanation: With an index on the sale_date column, the database can quickly locate the rows that match the specified date without scanning the entire table. The index allows for efficient lookup of rows based on the sale_date value, resulting in improved query performance.
5. Create a view named Top_products that lists the top 3 products based on the total quantity sold.
Query:
CREATE VIEW Top_products AS
SELECT
p.product_name,
SUM(s.quantity_sold) AS total_quantity_sold
FROM sales s
JOIN products p
ON s.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_name
ORDER BY total_quantity_sold DESC
FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY;
Output:
Explanation: This query creates a view named Top_products that lists the top 3 products based on the total quantity sold.
6. Use a transaction to insert a new sale and update the product price based on the sale, ensuring both operations are committed together.
Query:
START TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO sales (product_id, quantity_sold, sale_date, total_price)
SELECT 101, 5, CURRENT_DATE, unit_price * 5

Transaction committed successfully.
Explanation: The sale for product with product_id 101 should be recorded successfully with the calculated total_price. The transaction should be committed successfully.
7. Create a query that lists the product names along with their corresponding sales count.
Query:
SELECT p.product_name, COUNT(s.sale_id) AS sales_count
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN sales s ON p.product_id = s.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_name;

8. Write a query to find all sales where the total price is greater than the average total price of all sales.
Query:
SELECT *
FROM sales
WHERE total_price > (SELECT AVG(total_price) FROM sales);
Output:
Explanation: The subquery (SELECT AVG(total_price) FROM sales) calculates the average total price of all sales. The main query selects all columns from the sales table where the total price is greater than the average total price obtained from the subquery.
9. Add a check constraint to the quantity_sold column in the sales table to ensure that the quantity sold is always greater than zero.
Query:
ALTER TABLE sales
ADD CONSTRAINT chk_quantity_sold CHECK (quantity_sold > 0);

Query:
UPDATE products
SET unit_price = 2500.00
WHERE product_id = 101;
Output:
There is no direct output shown here as this is a stored procedure definition
Explanation: The above SQL code creates a stored procedure named Update_Unit_Price. This stored procedure takes two parameters: p_product_id (the product ID for which the unit price needs to be updated) and p_new_price (the new unit price to set).
12. Implement a transaction that inserts a new product into the products table and then adds a corresponding sale record into the sales table, ensuring that both operations are either fully completed or fully rolled back.
Query:
START TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO products (product_id, product_name, category, unit_price)
VALUES (106, 'Headphones', 'Electronics', 2500.00);
INSERT INTO sales (sale_id, product_id, quantity_sold, sale_date, total_price)
