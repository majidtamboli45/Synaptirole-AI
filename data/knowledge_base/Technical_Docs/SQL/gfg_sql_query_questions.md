# SQL Query  Questions

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql/sql-query-interview-questions/

SQL queries are widely used to retrieve, analyze and manage data stored in relational databases. The following examples use three sample tables to demonstrate commonly used SQL concepts and query techniques.
- Data Retrieval and Filtering
- JOIN Operations
- Aggregate Functions
- GROUP BY and HAVING Clauses
The following tables will be used to demonstrate the SQL queries.
Student Table
Program Table
Scholarship Table
The following examples demonstrate commonly used SQL queries and concepts.
1. Write a SQL query to fetch "FIRST_NAME" from the Student table in upper case and use ALIAS name as STUDENT_NAME.
