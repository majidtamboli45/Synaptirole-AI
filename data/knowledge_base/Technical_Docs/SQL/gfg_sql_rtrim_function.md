# SQL RTRIM() Function

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql/rtrim-function-in-sql/

The RTRIM() function is used in SQL to remove extra spaces from the right end of a string. It helps clean and standardize text data for better storage and comparison.
- Does not remove leading (left-side) spaces.
- Supported by major databases like MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle and Azure SQL.
Query:
SELECT RTRIM('Hello World     ') AS trimmed_text;
Output:
- Removes extra spaces from the right side of the text.
- Returns the cleaned result as trimmed_text.
Syntax
RTRIM( input_text,[trim_characters]);
OR
RTRIM(column_name) AS trimmed_name
FROM table_name;
- RTRIM(input_text, [Trim_Characters]) removes specified characters from the right side of the text.
- RTRIM(column_name) removes trailing spaces from a column and displays it as trimmed_name.
Examples
Let's see some examples of RTRIM function in SQL and understand it's working with examples of different use cases.
Example 1: Using RTRIM Function to Remove Trailing Spaces from a String
The RTRIM function in SQL is used to remove trailing spaces from a string. Here are a few examples to illustrate its usage:
Query:
SELECT '[' || '          Geeks for Geeks          ' || ']' AS before_rtrim,
'[' || RTRIM(' Geeks for Geeks ') || ']' AS after_rtrim;
Output:
- Displays the original string with leading and trailing spaces as "before_rtrim".
- Removes only the right-side (trailing) spaces and shows the result as "after_rtrim".
Example 2: Using RTRIM Function on Table Column
First, we create a table GFG, with following commands in which we add names with trailing whitespaces.
SELECT
id,
'[' || name || ']' AS name,
'[' || RTRIM(name) || ']' AS trimmed_name
FROM GFG;
Output:
Example 3: Using RTRIM Function With a Variable
This example demonstrates how the RTRIM() function is used with a variable to remove trailing spaces and return a cleaned result.
Query:
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE rtrim_example()
BEGIN
DECLARE input_string VARCHAR(15);
SET input_string = 'Hello ';
SELECT CONCAT(RTRIM(input_string), ' World') AS result;
END //
DELIMITER ;
CALL rtrim_example();
Output:
- Creates a stored procedure that trims trailing spaces using RTRIM().
- Uses CONCAT() to append "World" to the trimmed string.
- Executes the procedure with CALL rtrim_example().
- Changes the delimiter to // so the entire procedure is treated as a single statement.
