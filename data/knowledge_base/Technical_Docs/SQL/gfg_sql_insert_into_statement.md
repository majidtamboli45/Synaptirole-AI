# SQL INSERT INTO Statement

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql/sql-insert-statement/

The SQL INSERT INTO statement is used to add new records into a table. It allows inserting data into all columns or specific ones, depending on the requirement.
- Can insert a single row or multiple rows at once.
- Supports inserting data directly or from another table using a subquery.
Working
The INSERT INTO statement is used to add new records to a table. It can insert single rows, multiple rows, selected columns or data from another table.
Inserting Data into All Columns
This method inserts values into all columns of a table by providing values in the same order as the columns are defined.
Syntax:
INSERT INTO table_name 
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
- table_name: name of the table where data will be inserted
- value1, value2... : values that correspond to each column in order.
Example
First, create a table named student.
Query:
INSERT INTO student
VALUES (5, 'Isabella', 'Rome', 'xxxxxxxxxx', 19);
Output:
Inserting Data into Specific Columns
In some cases, you might want to insert data into only certain columns, leaving the others empty or with default values. In such cases, we can specify the column names explicitly.
Syntax:
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
- table_name: name of the table.
- column1, column2..: name of first column, second column.
- value1, value2, value3..: the values for each specified column of the new record.
Example: If we want to insert the roll_no, name and age into the student table and leave the address and phone number as NULL (the default value).
INSERT INTO student(roll_no, name,age) 
VALUES (6, 'Hiroshi', 19);
Output:
Inserting Multiple Rows at Once
Instead of running multiple INSERT INTO commands, you can insert multiple rows into a table in a single query. This is more efficient and reduces the number of database operations.
Syntax:
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...), (value1, value2, ...), (value1, value2, ...);
Example: If we want to add multiple students to student table in one go, query would look like this:
INSERT INTO student (roll_no, name, address, phone, age)
VALUES
(7, 'Mateo Garcia', 'Madrid', 'xxxxxxxxxx', 15),
(8, 'Hana Suzuki', 'Osaka', 'xxxxxxxxxx', 18),
(9, 'Oliver Jensen', 'Copenhagen', 'xxxxxxxxxx', 17),
(10, 'Amelia Brown', 'London', 'xxxxxxxxxx', 17);
Output:
Inserting Data from One Table into Another Table
We can copy records from old_student to student using the INSERT INTO SELECT statement.
Method 1: Insert All Columns from Another Table
Inserts every column from source table into destination table.
Syntax:
INSERT INTO target_table
SELECT * FROM source_table;
Example: If you want to copy all data from the old_student table into the student table, use this query:
INSERT INTO student
SELECT * FROM old_student;
Output:
Method 2: Insert Specific Columns from Another Table
Allows inserting only selected columns from the source table.
Syntax:
INSERT INTO target_table (col1, col2, ...)
SELECT col1, col2, ...
FROM source_table;
Example: If we want to copy only the Name and Age columns from old_student into student:
INSERT INTO student (name, age)
SELECT name, age
FROM old_student;
Output:
Method 3: Insert Specific Rows Based on Condition
We can also insert specific rows based on a condition by using the WHERE clause with the SELECT statement.
Syntax:
INSERT INTO target_table
SELECT * FROM source_table
WHERE condition;
Example: If we want to copy only students older than 20 years from old_student to student, we would write:
INSERT INTO student
SELECT * FROM old_student
WHERE age > 20;
Output:
