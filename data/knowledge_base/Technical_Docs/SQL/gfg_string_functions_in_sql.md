# String functions in SQL

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql/sql-string-functions/

SQL string functions help manipulate and format text data efficiently. They are widely used for cleaning, comparing and extracting meaningful information from textual fields.
- Improve query flexibility when working with textual data.
- Help prepare data for analysis and presentation.
The following advanced string functions help perform specialized text-processing operations in SQL.
CONCAT()
The CONCAT() function is used to concatenate (combine) two or more strings into one string. It is useful when we want to merge fields like first and last names into a full name.
Query:
SELECT CONCAT('John', ' ', 'Doe') AS FullName;
Output:
John Doe
CHAR_LENGTH() / CHARACTER_LENGTH()
The CHAR_LENGTH() or LENGTH() function returns the length of a string in characters. It’s essential for validating or manipulating text data, especially when you need to know how many characters a string contains.
Query:
SELECT CHAR_LENGTH('Hello') AS StringLength;
Output:
5
UPPER() and LOWER()
These UPPER() and LOWER() functions convert the text to uppercase or lowercase, respectively. They are useful for normalizing the case of text in a database.
Query:
SELECT UPPER('hello') AS UpperCase;
SELECT LOWER('HELLO') AS LowerCase;
Output:
HELLO
hello
REPLACE()
The REPLACE() function replaces occurrences of a substring within a string with another substring. This is useful for cleaning up data, such as replacing invalid characters or formatting errors.
Query:
SELECT REPLACE('Hello World', 'World', 'SQL') AS UpdatedString;
Output:
Hello SQL
SUBSTRING() / SUBSTR()
The SUBSTRING() (or SUBSTR()) function is used to extract a substring from a string, starting from a specified position.
Query:
SELECT SUBSTRING('Hello World', 1, 5) AS SubStringExample;
Output:
Hello
LEFT() and RIGHT()
The LEFT() and RIGHT() functions allow you to extract a specified number of characters from the left or right side of a string, respectively. It is used for truncating strings for display.
Query:
SELECT LEFT('Hello World', 5) AS LeftString;
SELECT RIGHT('Hello World', 5) AS RightString;
Output:
Hello    
World
INSTR()
The INSTR() function is used to find the position of the first occurrence of a substring within a string. It returns the position (1-based index) of the substring. If the substring is not found, it returns 0.
SELECT INSTR('Hello World', 'World') AS SubstringPosition;
Output:
7
TRIM()
The TRIM() function removes leading and trailing spaces (or other specified characters) from a string. By default, it trims spaces but can also remove specific characters using TRIM(character FROM string).
Query:
SELECT TRIM(' ' FROM '  Hello World  ') AS TrimmedString;
Output:
Hello World
REVERSE()
The REVERSE() function reverses the characters in a string. It’s useful in situations where we need to process data backward, such as for password validation or certain pattern matching.
Query:
SELECT REVERSE('Hello') AS ReversedString;
Output:
olleH
RTRIM()
RTRIM() removes trailing characters from the right side of a string. By default, it removes spaces, but you can specify other characters as well.
Query:
SELECT RTRIM('geeks   ');
Output:
 ‘geeks’
SPACE()
The SPACE() function generates a string consisting of a specified number of spaces. This is useful when you need to format output or create padding in your queries.
Query:
SELECT SPACE(7);
Output:
 ‘       ‘
Advanced String Functions
Advanced string functions provide additional ways to manipulate and process text data in SQL.
ASCII()
The ASCII() function returns the ASCII value of a single character. This is helpful when we need to find the numeric code corresponding to a character, often used in encoding and decoding text.
Query:
SELECT ASCII('t');
Output:
 116
CONCAT_WS()
CONCAT_WS() stands for "Concatenate With Separator." It allows us to join multiple strings with a specific separator between them. This is ideal when we need to merge columns like first name and last name with a custom separator.
Query:
SELECT CONCAT_WS('_', 'geeks', 'for', 'geeks');
Output:
geeks_for_geeks
FORMAT()
The FORMAT() function is used to format a number as a string in a specific way, often with commas for thousands or with a specific number of decimal places. It is handy when you need to display numbers in a user-friendly format.
Query:
SELECT FORMAT(0.981 * 100, 'N2') + '%' AS PercentageOutput;
Output:
‘98.10%’
LOCATE()
LOCATE() allows you to find the nth occurrence of a substring in a string. This is especially useful when you need to locate a specific substring based on its position.
Query:
SELECT LOCATE('for', 'geeksforgeeks', 1);
Output:
 6
LPAD()
LPAD() is used to pad a string to a certain length by adding characters to the left side of the original string. It is useful when you need to format data to a fixed length.
Query:
SELECT LPAD('geeks', 8, '0');
Output:
000geeks
POSITION()
The POSITION() function finds the position of the first occurrence of a specified character in a string.
Query:
SELECT POSITION('e' IN 'geeksforgeeks');
Output:
2
REPEAT()
The REPEAT() function repeats a string a specified number of times. It's useful when you need to duplicate a string or pattern for certain operations.
Query:
SELECT REPEAT('geeks', 2);
Output:
geeksgeeks
RPAD()
RPAD() pads the right side of a string with specified characters to a fixed length. This is often used to format text or numbers to a desired size.
Query:
SELECT RPAD('geeks', 8, '0');
Output:
 ‘geeks000’
STRCMP()
STRCMP() compares two strings and returns an integer value based on their lexicographical comparison. This is useful for sorting or checking equality between two strings. STRCMP(string1, string2) returns:
- 0 if both strings are equal.
- A negative value if string1 is less than string2.
- A positive value if string1 is greater than string2.
Query:
SELECT STRCMP('google.com', 'geeksforgeeks.com');
Output:
 1
