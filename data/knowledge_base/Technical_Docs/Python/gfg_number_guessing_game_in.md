# Number Guessing Game in Python

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/number-guessing-game-in-python/

Number Guessing Game is a game in which the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100. The user must guess the number within a limited number of attempts. After each incorrect guess, the program provides a hint indicating whether the guess is too low or too high.
In this game, randint() is used to generate a random number within the specified range.
Winning Rules
- Computer generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- User has a maximum of 7 attempts to guess the number.
- User wins immediately if the guess matches the randomly generated number.
- If the guess is lower than the selected number, the program displays "Too Low" and the user should try a higher number.
- If the guess is higher than the selected number, the program displays "Too High" and the user should try a lower number.
- Invalid input or numbers outside the range of 1 to 100 do not count as an attempt.
- If the user does not guess the number within 7 valid attempts, the game ends and reveals the correct number.
Implementation
import random
attempts = 7
def display_rules():
    print("Welcome to Number Guessing Game!\n")
    print("I have selected a number between 1 and 100.")
    print("You have 7 attempts to guess it.\n")
def play_game(number, attempt=1):
    if attempt > attempts:
        print("\nGame Over!")
        print("The correct number was:", number)
        return
    guess = input(f"Attempt {attempt}/7 - Enter your guess: ")
    try:
        guess = int(guess)
    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter a valid number.\n")
        return play_game(number, attempt)
    if guess < 1 or guess > 100:
        print("Please enter a number between 1 and 100.\n")
        return play_game(number, attempt)
    check_guess = lambda x, y: "correct" if x == y else (
        "low" if x < y else "high"
    )
    result = check_guess(guess, number)
    if result == "correct":
        print("\nCongratulations! You guessed the correct number!")
        print("You guessed it in", attempt, "attempt(s).")
        return
    if result == "low":
        print("Too Low! Try a higher number.\n")
    else:
        print("Too High! Try a lower number.\n")
    play_game(number, attempt + 1)
# Start the game
display_rules()
random_number = random.randint(1, 100)
play_game(random_number)
Output:
Explanation:
- Program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- User gets 7 attempts to guess the number.
- display_rules() displays the game instructions.
- play_game() takes the generated number and handles the guessing process.
- Program checks whether the entered value is a valid number between 1 and 100.
- For each incorrect guess, it displays whether the number is too low or too high.
- If the user guesses correctly, the program displays a congratulatory message and the number of attempts used.
- If all 7 attempts are used, the game ends and displays the correct number.
- check_guess lambda function compares the user's guess with the generated number.
- Function calls itself with the next attempt until the user wins or all attempts are completed.
