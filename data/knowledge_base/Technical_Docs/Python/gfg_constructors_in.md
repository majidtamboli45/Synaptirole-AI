# Constructors in Python

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/constructors-in-python/

Constructors are special methods used to initialize objects when they are created from a class. Object creation and initialization are handled through the __new__() and __init__() methods. Constructors help assign initial values to object attributes and prepare objects for use.
When an object is created:
- The __new__() method creates and returns a new instance of the class.
- The __init__() method initializes the newly created object.
- The object becomes ready for use.
__new__() Method
This method is responsible for creating a new instance of a class. It allocates memory and returns the new object. It is called before __init__.
Syntax:
class ClassName:
    def __new__(cls, parameters):
        instance = super(ClassName, cls).__new__(cls)
        return instance
__new__() controls the actual creation of an object before __init__() initializes it. It is rarely needed in everyday Python programming, but it is useful when creating immutable objects, implementing singleton patterns, or controlling which instance gets created.

__init__() Method
This method initializes the newly created instance and is commonly used as a constructor in Python. It is called immediately after the object is created by __new__ method and is responsible for initializing attributes of the instance.
Syntax:
class ClassName:
    def __init__(self, parameters):
        self.attribute = value
Note: It is called after __new__ and does not return anything (it returns None by default). To learn more, please refer to this article: __init__
__init__ vs __new__
| Feature | __new__() | __init__() | 
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | Creates an object | Initializes an object | 
| Called When | Before object creation completes | After object creation | 
| Return Value | Must return an object instance | Returns None | 
| Usage | Rarely overridden | Commonly overridden | 
| Typical Use Case | Singleton, immutable objects | Setting attribute values | 
Types of Constructors
1. Default Constructor: does not take any parameters other than self. It initializes the object with default attribute values.
class Car:
    def __init__(self):
        self.make = "Toyota"
        self.model = "Corolla"
        self.year = 2020
car = Car()
print(car.make)
print(car.model)
print(car.year)
Output
Toyota
Corolla
2020
Note: If no constructor is defined in a class, Python automatically provides a default constructor that creates the object without initializing custom attributes.
Explanation:
- Define Constructor: __init__() is defined without additional parameters.
- Initialize Attributes: Default values are assigned to make, model, and year.
- Create Object: Car() automatically invokes the constructor.
- Access Attributes: Object attributes are printed using dot notation.
2. Parameterized Constructor: accepts arguments to initialize the object's attributes with specific values.
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
car = Car("Honda", "Civic", 2022)
print(car.make)
print(car.model)
print(car.year)
Output
Honda
Civic
2022
Explanation:
- Accept Parameters: The constructor receives make, model, and year as arguments.
- Assign Values: Constructor arguments are assigned to instance attributes.
- Create Object: Values are passed while creating the object.
- Display Attributes: The stored values are accessed through the object.
