# Rock Paper Scissor Game in Python

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-program-implement-rock-paper-scissor-game/

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a game where player selects one of three options. Then the computer simultaneously makes a random selection. The program compares both choices using the game rules and declares the winner. The game can be played repeatedly until the user decides to quit.
Winning Rules
- Rock defeats Scissors.
- Scissors defeats Paper.
- Paper defeats Rock.
- If both players choose the same option, the round ends in a draw.
In this game, randint() built-in function is used for generating random integer values within the given range.
Algorithm
- Display the rules of the game.
- Accept the user's choice.
- Validate the input and ensure it is within the allowed options.
- Generate the computer's choice randomly.
- Compare both choices and determine the winner.
- Display the result of the round.
- Ask the user whether they want to play again.
- Repeat the game until the user chooses to exit.
Implementation
import random
# Display game rules
print("Welcome to Rock-Paper-Scissors!\n")
print("Winning Rules:")
print("Rock vs Paper -> Paper wins")
print("Rock vs Scissors -> Rock wins")
print("Paper vs Scissors -> Scissors wins\n")
choices = ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"]
while True:
    print("Choose an option:")
    print("1 - Rock")
    print("2 - Paper")
    print("3 - Scissors")
    # Validate user input
    try:
        choice = int(input("Enter your choice: "))
    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter a valid number.\n")
        continue
    while choice < 1 or choice > 3:
        choice = int(input("Please enter a valid choice (1-3): "))
    # User choice
    user_choice = choices[choice - 1]
    print("\nUser choice is:", user_choice)
    print("Now it's Computer's Turn...")
    # Computer choice
    comp_choice = random.randint(1, 3)
    computer_choice = choices[comp_choice - 1]
    print("Computer choice is:", computer_choice)
    print(user_choice, "vs", computer_choice)
    # Determine winner
    if choice == comp_choice:
        print("<== It's a Tie! ==>")
    elif (
        (choice == 1 and comp_choice == 3) or
        (choice == 2 and comp_choice == 1) or
        (choice == 3 and comp_choice == 2)
    ):
        print("<== User Wins! ==>")
    else:
        print("<== Computer Wins! ==>")
    # Play again
    while True:
        ans = input("\nDo you want to play again? (Y/N): ").lower()
        if ans in ['y', 'n']:
            break
        print("Please enter Y or N.")
    if ans == 'n':
        break
    print()
print("\nThanks for playing!")
Output:
Explanation:
- List is used to store the three possible options: Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
- Program uses try-except and conditional checks to ensure the user enters a valid choice.
- random.randint() function generates a random choice for the computer.
- User and computer selections are converted from numeric values to their corresponding string representations.
- Conditional statements compare the selected options and identify the winner or a draw.
- While loop allows multiple rounds to be played until the user chooses to exit the game.
