# Tic Tac Toe Game in Python

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-implementation-automatic-tic-tac-toe-game-using-random-number/

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game played on a 3×3 grid. Players take turns placing X and O on the board and the first player to get three symbols in a row wins the game.
Winning Rules
-  Player X and PlayerO take turns making moves.
- A player wins by placing three of their symbols in a row.
- The three symbols can be in a row, column, or diagonal.
- If all 9 positions are filled and no player wins, the game is a draw.
- A position already occupied by a player cannot be selected again.
Algorithm
- Create a 3×3 board with numbered positions.
- Display the board and ask the first player to choose a position.
- Validate the user's input and check whether the position is available.
- Place the player's symbol on the selected position.
- Check all possible winning combinations.
- If a player has three symbols in a row, declare that player the winner.
- If all positions are filled without a winner, declare the game a draw.
- Switch to the other player.
- Repeat the process until the game ends.
Implementation
board = ["1", "2", "3",
         "4", "5", "6",
         "7", "8", "9"]
players = {
    "X": "Player 1",
    "O": "Player 2"
}
winning_combinations = (
    (0, 1, 2),
    (3, 4, 5),
    (6, 7, 8),
    (0, 3, 6),
    (1, 4, 7),
    (2, 5, 8),
    (0, 4, 8),
    (2, 4, 6)
)
occupied = set()
def display_board():
    print()
    print(board[0], "|", board[1], "|", board[2])
    print("--+---+--")
    print(board[3], "|", board[4], "|", board[5])

    return False
def make_move(symbol):
    while True:
        choice = input(
            f"{players[symbol]} ({symbol}), choose a position (1-9): "
        )
        if not choice.isdigit():
            print("Please enter a valid number.")
            continue
        position = int(choice) - 1
        if position < 0 or position > 8:
            print("Please choose a position between 1 and 9.")
            continue
        if position in occupied:
            print("This position is already occupied.")
            continue
        board[position] = symbol
        occupied.add(position)
        break
print("Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe!")
current_player = "X"
while True:

    if check_winner(current_player):
        display_board()
        print(players[current_player], "wins!")
        break
    if len(occupied) == 9:
        display_board()

print("\nThanks for playing!")
Output:
Explanation:
- Program starts with a board containing positions from 1 to 9 and displays it in a 3×3 format.
- Each player is assigned a symbol, with Player 1 using X and Player 2 using O.
- Game accepts a position from the current player and checks whether the input is valid and the selected position is free.
- After every valid move, the board is updated with the player's symbol.
- Program checks the predefined winning combinations after each move to determine whether the current player has won.
- If all 9 positions are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
- Players take turns until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
- Final board and game result are displayed when the game ends.
