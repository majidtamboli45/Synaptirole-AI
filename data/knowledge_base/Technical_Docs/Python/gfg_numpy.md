NumPy is a core Python library for numerical computing, built for handling large arrays and matrices efficiently. It is significantly faster than Python's built-in lists because it uses optimized C language style storage where actual values are stored at contiguous locations (not object reference).
- ndarray object: N-dimensional array for fast numerical operations.
- Vectorized operations: Perform element-wise calculations without loops.
- Broadcasting: Operate on arrays of different shapes.
- Linear algebra functions: Matrix operations like multiplication and inversion.
- Statistical functions: Mean, median, standard deviation.
- Integration: Works with Pandas, SciPy and scikit-learn.
Why Learn NumPy?
- Executes vectorized operations 10 to 100 times faster than standard Python loops.
- Uses homogeneous arrays to store large datasets more compactly than Python lists.
- Provides optimized functions for linear algebra, Fourier transforms and matrix manipulations.
- Includes robust tools for statistics, random number generation and missing data management.
- Expresses complex math in single-line commands, eliminating the need for manual, nested loops.
Basics
This section covers NumPy installation, importing, core features and its advantages over Python lists for numerical computing.
NumPy Arrays
NumPy arrays (ndarrays) are the backbone of the library. This section covers how to create and manipulate arrays effectively for data storage and processing
import numpy as np
a = [9,3,3,5]
print(np.array(a))  # Converting list into numpy array
Output
[9 3 3 5]
Mathematical Operations
This section covers essential mathematical functions for array computations, including basic arithmetic, aggregation and mathematical transformations.
import numpy as np
n = np.array([9,3,3,5])
print(n.mean())    # Calculating mean
Output
5.0
- Basic Arithmetic Operations
- Aggregation Functions: sum, mean, max, min
- Universal Functions
- Mathematical Functions
Linear Algebra
NumPy provides built-in functions for linear algebra operations essential for scientific computing and machine learning applications.
import numpy as np
A = np.array([[1, 2],
              [3, 4]])
res = np.dot(A, A)    # Matrix multiplication
print(res) 
Output
[[ 7 10]
 [15 22]]
Random Number Generation and Statistics
NumPy’s random module provides a list of functions for generating random numbers, which are essential for simulations, cryptography and machine learning applications.
import numpy as np
a = np.random.normal(0, 1, 5)    # 5 values from normal distribution
print("Data:", a)
print("Mean:", np.mean(a))
Output
Data: [ 0.50380896  1.56391917 -0.25398057 -0.31520396  0.4174568 ]
Mean: 0.38320007938038125
Advanced Operations
This section includes vectorized operations for speed optimization, memory management strategies and integration with Pandas for efficient data analysis.
import numpy as np
a = np.arange(5)
r = a * 10    # Vectorized operation (fast and efficient)
print(r)
Output
[ 0 10 20 30 40]
