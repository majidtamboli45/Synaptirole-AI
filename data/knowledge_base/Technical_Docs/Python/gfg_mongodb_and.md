MongoDB is an open-source NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents (BSON format).
- Handles large, unstructured or semi-structured data efficiently
- Adapts easily to changing data models
- Supports fast read/write operations for real-time applications and APIs
- Integrates seamlessly with Python using libraries like pymongo
MongoDB vs RDBMS
Connecting MongoDB with Python Using PyMongo
Step 1: Start MongoDB
Start MongoDB from the command prompt using the following command:
If starting with default settings:
mongod
When running directly with custom data directory:
mongod --dbpath "C:\data"
If MongoDB is installed as a Windows service:
net start MongoDB
See port number by default is set 27017 (last 2-3 lines in above image).
Step 2: Install and Import PyMongo
PyMongo is the native Python library for MongoDB. To install PyMongo, open Command Prompt and run:
pip install pymongo
After installation, open a Python environment and import the library:
from pymongo import MongoClient
Step 3: Connect to MongoDB Server Locally
To connect to a local MongoDB server, create a MongoClient object:
client = MongoClient()
Connect to the default MongoDB host and port (localhost:27017) using the following command to create a MongoClient explicitly.
client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
Step 4: Connect to MongoDB Atlas (Cloud Database)
To connect to a cloud-based MongoDB database like MongoDB Atlas, follow these steps:
1. Create a MongoDB Atlas Account: Go to MongoDB Atlas and create an account if you don't already have one. Once logged in, create a new project, cluster, and database.
2. Get the Connection String: After creating the cluster, navigate to the Clusters tab, click Connect, and choose Connect your application. Select Python and copy the provided connection string.
3. Connection string typically looks like this:
mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority
4. Use the Connection String: Replace <username> and <password> with your MongoDB Atlas credentials.
client = MongoClient("mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority")
This will connect your Python application to the cloud-based MongoDB cluster.
Step 5: Access/Create a Database
To create a database or switch to an existing database use:
mydatabase = client["my_database"]
Or:
mydatabase = client.my_database
Note: Database names should not contain dashes (-). The names like my-Table will raise an error. Use underscores (_) instead.
Step 6: Access/Create a Collection
Collections are equivalent to Tables in Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS). A collection in PyMongo is accessed similarly to how tables are accessed in RDBMS.
To access the table, table name "myTable" of the database "mydatabase".
mycollection = mydatabase["myTable"]
MongoDB store the database in the form of dictionaries as shown:
record = {
    "title": "MongoDB and Python",
    "description": "MongoDB is no SQL database",
    "tags": ["mongodb", "database", "NoSQL"],
    "viewers": 104
}
'_id' is a 12 bytes hexadecimal number. A special key which uniquely identifies each document in a collection and automatically added when not added explicitly.
Step 7: Inserting data inside collection
Methods used:
insert_one() or insert_many()
Insert the document into a collection:
rec = mycollection.insert_one(record)
The complete code looks like this when implemented:
from pymongo import MongoClient
client=MongoClient()
client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
mydb = client["my_database"]
mycollection = mydb["myTable"]
record = {
    "title": "MongoDB and Python",
    "description": "MongoDB is no SQL database",
    "tags": ["mongodb", "database", "NoSQL"],
    "viewers": 104
}
rec = mycollection.insert_one(record)
Step 8: Querying the Database
Certain query functions are used to filter data in a MongoDB database. Among them, the two most commonly used are:
find(): used to retrieve multiple documents from a collection that match a given query.
for i in mycollection.find({"title": "MongoDB and Python"}):
      print(i)
count_documents(): used to count the number of documents in a collection that match a specific query.
count = mycollection.count_documents({"title": "MongoDB and Python"})
print(count)
To print all the documents/entries inside 'myTable' of database 'mydatabase':
from pymongo import MongoClient
try:
    conn = MongoClient("localhost", 27017)
    print("Connected successfully!")
except Exception as e:
    print("Could not connect to MongoDB:", e)
db = conn["mydatabase"]
collection = db["myTable"]
for record in collection.find():
    print(record)
Explanation:
- connects to the local MongoDB server on port 27017 using MongoClient.
- accesses the mydatabase database and myTable collection.
- uses find() to retrieve all documents from the collection and prints it.
