User-defined exceptions are created by defining a new class that inherits from Python's built-in Exception class or one of its subclasses. By doing this, we can create custom error messages and handle specific errors in a way that makes sense for our application.
Steps to Create and Use User-Defined Exceptions
Follow these steps to create and use User-Defined Exceptions in Python:
- Define a New Exception Class: Create a new class that inherits from Exception or any of its subclasses.
- Raise the Exception: Use the raise statement to raise the user-defined exception when a specific condition occurs.
- Handle the Exception: Use try-except blocks to handle the user-defined exception.
Example: In this example, we create a custom exception InvalidAgeError to ensure that age values fall within a valid range (0–120).
# Step 1: Define a custom exception class
class InvalidAgeError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, age, msg="Age must be between 0 and 120"):
        self.age = age
        self.msg = msg
        super().__init__(self.msg)
    def __str__(self):
        return f'{self.age} -> {self.msg}'
# Step 2: Use the custom exception in your code
def set_age(age):
    if age < 0 or age > 120:
        raise InvalidAgeError(age)
    else:
        print(f"Age set to: {age}")
# Step 3: Handling the custom exception
try:
    set_age(150)  # This will raise the custom exception
except InvalidAgeError as e:
    print(e)
Output
150 -> Age must be between 0 and 120
Explanation:
- InvalidAgeError class inherits from Exception. It defines an __init__ method to accept age and message.
- The __str__ method returns a readable string representation of the error.
- In set_age(), if the age is outside the valid range (0–120), the exception is raised.
- The try-except block catches the exception and prints the error message.
Customizing Exception Classes
When we create a custom exception, we subclass Python’s built-in Exception class (or a subclass like ValueError, TypeError, etc.). We can then add our own attributes, methods or custom logic to make our exception more informative.
We can also enhance custom exceptions by adding extra attributes or overriding methods.
Example: Here, we improve the InvalidAgeError by adding an error code and customizing the error message.
class InvalidAgeError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, age, msg="Age must be between 0 and 120", error_code=1001):
        self.age = age
        self.msg = msg
        self.error_code = error_code
        super().__init__(self.msg)
    def __str__(self):
        return f"[Error Code {self.error_code}] {self.age} -> {self.msg}"
        
def set_age(age):
    if age < 0 or age > 120:
        raise InvalidAgeError(age)
    else:
        print(f"Age set to: {age}")        
        
try:
    set_age(150)  # This will raise the custom exception
except InvalidAgeError as e:
    print(e)
Output
[Error Code 1001] 150 -> Age must be between 0 and 120
Explanation:
- InvalidAgeError now has an additional attribute error_code.
- __str__ method is overridden to display both the error code and the age.
- When set_age(150) is executed, the exception is raised and caught in the try-except block.
- The customized error message is printed, making the error more descriptive.
Using Standard Exceptions as a Base Class
Sometimes, instead of directly inheriting from Exception, we can create a custom exception by subclassing a standard exception such as RuntimeError, ValueError, etc. This is useful when your custom exception should be treated as a specific kind of error.
Example: This example shows how to create a custom exception NetworkError by inheriting from RuntimeError, which is a standard built-in exception.
# NetworkError has base RuntimeError and not Exception
class NetworkError(RuntimeError):
    def __init__(self, arg):
        self.args = (arg,)   # store as tuple
try:
    raise NetworkError("Connection failed")
except NetworkError as e:
    print(e.args)
Output
('Connection failed',)
Explanation:
- NetworkError inherits from RuntimeError, which is a built-in exception type.
- When raised, the message is stored in the args attribute as a tuple.
- The exception is caught and its stored arguments are displayed.
Real-World Example: Invalid Email Error
Here’s a simple example where we raise a custom exception if the email address is not valid:
class InvalidEmailError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, email, msg="Invalid email format"):
        self.email = email
        self.msg = msg
        super().__init__(self.msg)
    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.email} -> {self.msg}"
def set_email(email):
    if "@" not in email:
        raise InvalidEmailError(email)
    print(f"Email set to: {email}")
try:
    set_email("userexample.com")
except InvalidEmailError as e:
    print(e)
Output
userexample.com -> Invalid email format
Explanation:
- A new exception class InvalidEmailError is defined to validate email addresses.
- If the given email does not contain "@", the exception is raised.
- The try-except block catches the error and prints the formatted message.
When to Use User-Defined Exceptions?
User-defined exceptions should be considered in the following scenarios:
- Representing specific errors in an application (e.g., InvalidAgeError, DatabaseConnectionError).
- Providing clearer and more descriptive error messages.
- Handling a group of related errors separately using except.
By using user-defined exceptions, programs become more readable, maintainable and easier to debug.
