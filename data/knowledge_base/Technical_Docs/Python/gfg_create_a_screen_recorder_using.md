# Create a Screen recorder using Python

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/create-a-screen-recorder-using-python/

A screen recorder captures the activities performed on a computer screen and saves them as a video. Using Python, you can build a screen recorder with PyAutoGUI for taking screenshots, NumPy for processing image frames, and OpenCV for creating the video.
Prerequisites
Install the required libraries before running the program
- PyAutoGUI: Captures screenshots of the screen.
- NumPy: Converts screenshots into arrays for processing.
- OpenCV: Handles video creation and frame processing.
pip install numpy pyautogui opencv-python
Working of Screen Recorder
- Capture the Screen: The program continuously takes screenshots using PyAutoGUI.
- Convert Screenshots to Frames: Each screenshot is converted into a NumPy array that can be processed by OpenCV.
- Write Frames to a Video: OpenCV stores the captured frames in a video file using a specified codec and frame rate.
- Display Live Preview (Optional): A preview window shows the recording while it is in progress.
- Stop Recording: Pressing the q key stops the recording and saves the video.
Implementation
Step 1: Import the Required Libraries
Import the libraries required for screen capturing, image processing, and video creation.
import pyautogui
import cv2
import numpy as np
Explanation:
- pyautogui captures screenshots of the screen.
- cv2 provides functions for video creation and frame processing.
- numpy converts screenshots into arrays for OpenCV.
Step 2: Configure the Video Recorder
Set the screen resolution, output filename, video codec, frame rate, and create a VideoWriter object.
resolution = (1920, 1080)
codec = cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*"XVID")
filename = "Recording.avi"
fps = 60.0
out = cv2.VideoWriter(filename, codec, fps, resolution)
Explanation:
- resolution defines the dimensions of the recorded video.
- VideoWriter_fourcc() specifies the codec used for video compression.
- filename sets the name of the output video file.
- fps determines the number of frames recorded per second.
- VideoWriter() creates the object that writes frames to the video file.
Note: Ensure that the resolution matches your screen size. Using an incorrect resolution may result in distorted or cropped recordings.
Step 3: Create a Preview Window
Optional: To display the recording in real-time, we have to create an Empty window and resize it.
cv2.namedWindow("Live", cv2.WINDOW_NORMAL)
cv2.resizeWindow("Live", 480, 270)
Explanation:
- namedWindow() creates a window for displaying the recording.
- WINDOW_NORMAL allows the window to be resized.
- resizeWindow() sets the preview window size.
- This step is optional and does not affect the recording process.
Step 4: Capture and Save the Screen Recording
Capture screenshots continuously, convert them into frames, and save them to the output video.
while True:
    img = pyautogui.screenshot()
    frame = np.array(img)
    frame = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
    out.write(frame)
    cv2.imshow('Live', frame)
    if cv2.waitKey(1) == ord('q'):
        break
Explanation:
- screenshot() captures the current screen.
- np.array() converts the screenshot into an image array.
- cvtColor() converts the frame into a format supported by OpenCV.
- out.write() writes each frame to the output video.
- imshow() displays the live recording preview.
- waitKey(1) checks if the q key is pressed to stop recording.
Step 5: Release Resources
After everything is done, we will release the writer and destroy all windows opened by OpenCV.
out.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
Explanation:
- release() saves the recorded video and releases the VideoWriter object.
- destroyAllWindows() closes all windows opened by OpenCV.
- These statements ensure the program exits properly after recording is complete.
Output:
