# Python Collections Counter

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/counters-in-python-set-1/

Counter is a subclass of Python’s dict from the collections module. It is mainly used to count the frequency of elements in an iterable (like lists, strings or tuples) or from a mapping (dictionary). It provides a clean and efficient way to tally items without writing extra loops and comes with helpful built-in methods.
from collections import Counter
# Create a list of items
a = [1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4]
# Use Counter to count occurrences
cnt = Counter(a)
print(cnt)
Output
Counter({1: 3, 3: 2, 2: 1, 4: 1})
Explanation: Counter object shows that 1 appears 3 times, 3 appears 2 times, 2 appears once and 4 appears once.
Syntax
collections.Counter([iterable-or-mapping])
Parameters (all optional):
- iterable: Sequence like list, tuple, or string.
- mapping: Dictionary with elements as keys and counts as values.
- keyword arguments: String keys mapped to counts.
Return Type: Returns a collections.Counter object (dictionary-like).
Creating a Counter
We can create Counters from different data sources.
from collections import Counter
ctr1 = Counter([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]) # From a list
ctr2 = Counter({1: 2, 2: 3, 3: 1}) # From a dictionary
ctr3 = Counter('hello') # From a string
print(ctr1)
print(ctr2)
print(ctr3)
Output
Counter({3: 3, 2: 2, 1: 1})
Counter({2: 3, 1: 2, 3: 1})
Counter({'l': 2, 'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'o': 1})
Explanation:
- ctr1 counts numbers from a list.
- ctr2 directly takes a dictionary of counts.
- ctr3 counts characters in the string "hello".
Refer to collection module to learn in detail.
Accessing Counter Elements
We can access the count of each element using the element as the key. If an element is not in the Counter, it returns 0.
from collections import Counter
ctr = Counter([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3])
# Accessing count of an element
print(ctr[1])  
print(ctr[2])  
print(ctr[3])  
print(ctr[4])  # (element not present)
Output
1
2
3
0
Explanation: Counter returns the count of each element. If an element does not exist (4 in this case), it returns 0.
Why use Counter() instead of a normal dictionary?
Counter and dictionary are similar, but Counter provides additional functionality specifically for counting elements.
- Returns 0 for missing keys, whereas a dictionary raises a KeyError.
- Designed specifically for counting hashable items, while a dictionary is a general-purpose data structure.
- Provides built-in methods like most_common(), elements(), update() and subtract() for easier frequency operations.
- Supports arithmetic operations such as addition (+), subtraction (-), intersection (&) and union (|).
- Requires less manual code for counting compared to updating values in a dictionary.
Counter Methods
1. update(): Adds counts from another iterable or mapping. Existing counts increase and new elements are added.
from collections import Counter
ctr = Counter([1, 1, 2])
ctr.update([2, 2, 3, 3])
print(ctr)
Output
Counter({2: 3, 1: 2, 3: 2})
Explanation:
- ctr = Counter([1, 1, 2]) -> counts are {1:2, 2:1}
- ctr.update([2, 2, 3, 3]), 2 appears twice-> 2:1 becomes 2:3 and 3 appears twice -> added as 3:2
- Final Counter merges both sequences.
2. elements(): Returns an iterator over elements repeating each as many times as its count. Elements are returned in arbitrary order.
from collections import Counter
ctr = Counter([1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3])
items = list(ctr.elements())
print(items)  
Output
[1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3]
Explanation:
- ctr stores {1:2, 2:3, 3:1}
- ctr.elements() -> expands this into: 1 twice, 2 thrice and 3 once
- list() converts the iterator into a list.
3. most_common(): Returns a list of the n most common elements and their counts from the most common to the least. If n is not specified, it returns all elements in the Counter.
from collections import Counter
ctr = Counter([1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3])
common = ctr.most_common(2)
print(common) 
Output
[(3, 4), (2, 3)]
Explanation:
- ctr counts are {3:4, 2:3, 1:1}
- ctr.most_common(2) picks: 3 with count 4 and 2 with count 3
- Returned as a list of (element, count) pairs.
4. Increasing Count Manually: Increases the count of a single element by 1.
from collections import Counter
ctr = Counter([1, 1, 2, 3])
ctr[2] += 2
ctr[4] += 1
print(ctr)
Output
Counter({2: 3, 1: 2, 3: 1, 4: 1})
Explanation:
- ctr[2] += 2 -> 2 was 1, now becomes 3
- ctr[4] += 1 -> 4 was not present, so becomes 1
5. subtract(): Subtracts element counts from another iterable or mapping. Counts can go negative.
from collections import Counter
ctr = Counter([1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3])
ctr.subtract([2, 2, 3])
print(ctr)  
Output
Counter({1: 2, 2: 1, 3: 0})
Explanation:
- Original: {2:3, 1:2, 3:1}
- ctr.subtract([2, 2, 3]): 2 appears twice-> 2:3 becomes 2:1 and 3 appears once-> 3:1 becomes 3:0
- 1 is untouched because it does not appear in the subtract list.
Note: Counts can even go negative if subtraction exceeds the original count.
Arithmetic Operations on Counters
Counters support addition, subtraction, intersection and union operations, allowing for various arithmetic operations.
from collections import Counter
ctr1 = Counter([1, 2, 2, 3])
ctr2 = Counter([2, 3, 3, 4])
print(ctr1 + ctr2)   # Addition
print(ctr1 - ctr2)   # Subtraction 
print(ctr1 & ctr2)   # Intersection
print(ctr1 | ctr2)   # Union
Output
Counter({2: 3, 3: 3, 1: 1, 4: 1})
Counter({1: 1, 2: 1})
Counter({2: 1, 3: 1})
Counter({2: 2, 3: 2, 1: 1, 4: 1})
