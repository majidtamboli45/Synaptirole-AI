# JavaScript Operators

JavaScript operators are symbols or keywords used to perform operations on values and variables. They are the building blocks of JavaScript expressions and can manipulate data in various ways.
There are various operators supported by JavaScript:
1. JavaScript Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic Operators perform mathematical calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.
const sum = 5 + 3; // Addition
const diff = 10 - 2; // Subtraction
const p = 4 * 2; // Multiplication
const q = 8 / 2; // Division
console.log(sum, diff, p, q); 
- + adds two numbers.
- - subtracts the second number from the first.
- * multiplies two numbers.
- / divides the first number by the second.
2. JavaScript Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. They can also perform operations like addition or multiplication while assigning the value.
let n = 10;
n += 5;
n *= 2;
console.log(n);
- = assigns a value to a variable.
- += adds and assigns the result to the variable.
- *= multiplies and assigns the result to the variable.
3. JavaScript Comparison Operators
Comparison operators compare two values and return a boolean (true or false). They are useful for making decisions in conditional statements.
console.log(10 > 5);
console.log(10 === "10");
- > checks if the left value is greater than the right.
- === checks for strict equality (both type and value).
- Other operators include <, <=, >=, and !==.
4. JavaScript Logical Operators
Logical operators are mainly used to perform the logical operations that determine the equality or difference between the values.
const a = true, b = false;
console.log(a && b); // Logical AND
console.log(a || b); // Logical OR
- && returns true if both operands are true.
- || returns true if at least one operand is true.
- ! negates the boolean value.
5. JavaScript Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators perform operations on binary representations of numbers.
const res = 5 & 1; // Bitwise AND
console.log(res);
- & performs AND operation on each bit.
- | performs OR operation on each bit.
- ^ performs XOR (exclusive OR) on each bit.
- ~ inverts all bits (NOT operator).
- << shifts bits to the left.
- >> shifts bits to the right (with sign).
- >>> shifts bits to the right (without sign).
6. JavaScript Ternary Operator
The ternary operator is a shorthand for conditional statements. It takes three operands.
const age = 18;
const status = age >= 18 ? "Adult" : "Minor";
console.log(status);
condition ? expression1 : expression2 evaluates expression1 if the condition is true, otherwise evaluates expression2.
7. JavaScript Comma Operator
Comma Operator (,) mainly evaluates its operands from left to right sequentially and returns the value of the rightmost operand.
let n1, n2
const res = (n1 = 1, n2 = 2, n1 + n2);
console.log(res);
- The final result of the expression is the rightmost value.
8. JavaScript Unary Operators
Unary operators operate on a single operand (e.g., increment, decrement).
let x = 5;
console.log(+x);
console.log(-x);
console.log(++x);
console.log(--x);
console.log(!x);
- + converts a value to a number.
- - negates a value (changes its sign).
- ++ increments a value by 1.
- -- decrements a value by 1.
- ! converts to boolean and reverses the value (true ↔ false).
- typeof returns the data type of a variable.
- delete removes a property from an object.
9. JavaScript Relational Operators
JavaScript Relational operators are used to compare its operands and determine the relationship between them. They return a Boolean value (true or false) based on the comparison result.
const obj = { length: 10 };
console.log("length" in obj);
console.log([] instanceof Array);
- in checks if a property exists in an object.
- instanceof checks if an object is an instance of a constructor.
10. JavaScript BigInt Operators
BigInt operators allow calculations with numbers beyond the safe integer range.
const big1 = 123456789012345678901234567890n;
const big2 = 987654321098765432109876543210n;
console.log(big1 + big2);
- Operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication work with BigInt.
- Use n suffix to denote BigInt literals.
11. JavaScript String Operators
JavaScript String Operators include concatenation (+) and concatenation assignment (+=), used to join strings or combine strings with other data types.
const s = "Hello" + " " + "World";
console.log(s);
- + concatenates strings.
- += appends to an existing string.
12. JavaScript Chaining Operator (?.)
The optional chaining operator allows safe access to deeply nested properties without throwing errors if the property doesn’t exist.
const obj = { name: "Aman", address: { city: "Delhi" } };
console.log(obj.address?.city);
console.log(obj.contact?.phone);
Output
Delhi
undefined
- ?. safely accesses a property or method.
- Returns undefined if the property doesn’t exist.
