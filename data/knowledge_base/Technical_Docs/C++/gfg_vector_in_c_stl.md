# Vector in C++ STL

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp/vector-in-cpp-stl/

A vector in C++ is a dynamic sequence container provided by the Standard Template Library (STL). It stores elements in contiguous memory and automatically manages its storage as elements are added or removed.
- Vectors can dynamically grow or shrink during program execution.
- They provide constant-time random access and support efficient insertion and deletion at the end.
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    vector<int> v = {10, 20, 30, 40};
    for (int x : v) {
        cout << x << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}  
Output
10 20 30 40 
Declaration and Initialization
The vector class template is defined in the <vector> header file.
Syntax
vector<T> v;
where:
- T is the data type of the elements.
- v is the name of the vector.
Operations on a Vector
C++ vectors provide several functions to insert, access, modify, and remove elements.
Insert Elements
The push_back() function adds an element at the end of a vector, while insert() adds an element at a specified position.
- push_back(value): Inserts element at the end of the vector efficiently. Takes constant time O(1) on average, so it's very fast.
- insert(position, value): Inserts element at any position (beginning, middle, or end). Takes linear time O(n), as it shifts elements to make space.
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    vector<char> v = {'a', 'f', 'd'};
  
  	// Inserting 'z' at the back
  	v.push_back('z');
  
  	// Inserting 'c' at index 1
  	v.insert(v.begin() + 1, 'c');
  	for (char i : v)
        cout << i << " ";
    return 0;
}
Output
a c f d z 
Access elements
Vector elements can be accessed using the subscript operator [] or the at() function.
- v[i] provides direct access without bounds checking.
- v.at(i) performs bounds checking and throws std::out_of_range if the index is invalid.
- Both provide constant-time O(1) access.
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    vector<int> v = {10, 20, 30, 40};
    
    // Accessing using operator[]
    cout << "Element at index 2 using []: " << v[2] << endl;
    
    // Accessing using at()
    cout << "Element at index 3 using at(): " << v.at(3) << endl;
    
    // Uncommenting the next line will throw an 
    // out_of_range exception 
    // cout v.at(10)<<endl;
    return 0;
}
Output
Element at index 2 using []: 30
Element at index 3 using at(): 40
Update elements
An existing element can be modified using its index and the assignment operator.
- To update an element, you simply use its index with the assignment operator, for example v[i]=newValue;
- This replaces the old element at index i with the new value you want.
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    vector<int> v = {10, 20, 30};
    cout << "Original value at index 1: " << v[1] << endl;
    // Updating the element at index i
    v[1] = 50;
    cout << "Updated value at index 1: " << v[1] << endl;
    return 0;
}
Output
Original value at index 1: 20
Updated value at index 1: 50
Find Vector Size
The size() function returns the number of elements currently stored in a vector.
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    vector<char> v = {'a', 'c', 'f', 'd', 'z'};
    // Finding size
    cout << v.size();
  
    return 0;
}
Output
5
Traverse Vector
Traversing a vector means visiting its elements one by one. A vector can be traversed using an index-based loop, a range-based loop, or iterators.
- Traversing a vector means going through each element one by one, usually using a loop.
- We can use a for loop with an index (v[i]), a range-based for loop (for(int x: v)), or iterators.
- It takes linear time O(n) .
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    vector<char> v = {'a', 'c', 'f', 'd', 'z'};
    // Range-based loop
  	for (char i : v)
        cout << i << " ";
    return 0;
}
Output
a c f d z 
Note:
- Use "for (char &x : v)" when you want to modify the elements of the vector.
- Use "for (const char &x : v)" for read-only access, as it avoids copying and improves efficiency.
Delete Elements
The erase() function removes an element or a range of elements, while pop_back() removes the last element.
- erase() generally takes O(n) time because elements after the erased position may need to be shifted.
- pop_back() removes the last element in O(1) time.
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    vector<char> v = {'a', 'c', 'f', 'd', 'z'};
    // Deleting last element 'z'
  	v.pop_back();
  
  	// Deleting element 'f'
  	v.erase(find(v.begin(), v.end(), 'f'));
  	
  	for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++) {
        cout << v[i] << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
Output
a c d 
Check Whether a Vector is Empty
The empty() function checks whether a vector contains any elements. It returns true if the vector is empty and false otherwise.
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    vector<int>v;
    
    // Check if the vector is empty
    if(v.empty()){
        cout<<"Vector is empty."<<endl;
    }
    
    // Add an element
    v.push_back(100);
    if(!v.empty()){
        cout<<"Vector is not empty. First element "<<v[0]<<endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
Output
Vector is empty.
Vector is not empty. First element 100
Multidimensional Vectors
Multidimensional vectors are dynamic arrays that can store data in more than one dimension, like tables or grids. They are implemented using vector inside another vector, allowing flexible row-column (2D), or even higher-dimensional structures.
Syntax to declare a 2D vector:
vector<vector<int>> matrix;
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    // Declaring and Initializing a 2D vector
    vector<vector<int>> matrix = {
        {1, 2, 3},
        {4, 5, 6},
        {7, 8, 9}
    };
    // Traversing using range-based loop with auto
    for (const auto &row : matrix) {
        for (const auto &val : row) {
            cout << val << " ";
        }
        cout<<endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
Output
1 2 3 
4 5 6 
7 8 9 
Advantages of Vector
Vectors provide several advantages:
- Dynamic Size: The size can change during program execution.
- Random Access: Elements can be accessed directly using an index in O(1) time.
- Automatic Storage Management: The vector automatically manages its underlying storage.
- STL Compatibility: Vectors work with STL algorithms, iterators, and other containers.
