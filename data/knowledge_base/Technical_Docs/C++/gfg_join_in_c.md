# join() in C++

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp/std-thread-join-in-cpp/

std::thread::join() is a member function of the std::thread class that waits for a thread to complete its execution before the calling thread continues. It is defined in the <thread> header and is commonly used to synchronize threads.
- Blocks the calling thread until the target thread finishes execution.
- Ensures a thread completes before the program proceeds or exits.
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
using namespace std;
void task()
{
    cout << "Thread is executing\n";
}
int main()
{
    thread t(task);
    t.join();
    cout << "Main thread resumes\n";
    return 0;
}
Output
Thread is executing
Main thread resumes
Explanation: The main thread waits at join() until the worker thread finishes execution. Only after the worker thread completes does the main thread continue.
Syntax
void join();
- Parameters: This function does not accept any parameters.
- Return Value: It does not return any value.
Working of std::thread::join()
std::thread::join() synchronizes thread execution by making the calling thread wait until the associated thread finishes. Once the target thread completes, the waiting thread resumes execution.
The execution flow is as follows:
- Create a thread to execute a task independently.
- The new thread begins running concurrently with the calling thread.
- Invoke join() on the thread object.
- The calling thread waits until the associated thread completes execution.
- After the thread finishes, join() returns and the calling thread continues.
Example of std::thread::join()
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
using namespace std;
void threadFunction()
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++)
        cout << "Thread Function Executing\n";
}
int main()
{
    thread threadObj(threadFunction);
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
        cout << "Main Thread Executing\n";
    threadObj.join();
    cout << "Exit of Main Function\n";
    return 0;
}
Output
Main Thread Executing
Main Thread Executing
Main Thread Executing
Main Thread Executing
Main Thread Executing
Thread Function Executing
Thread Function Executing
Exit of Main Function
Explanation
- The main thread and worker thread execute concurrently.
- join() blocks the main thread until the worker thread finishes.
- The final statement executes only after the joined thread completes.
Rules for Using std::thread::join()
While using join(), keep the following rules in mind:
- A thread can be joined only once.
- After calling join(), the thread becomes non-joinable.
- Destroying a joinable thread object without calling join() or detach() terminates the program.
- Use detach() instead of join() if the thread should execute independently.
std::thread::joinable()
Before calling join(), it is good practice to check whether a thread is joinable using the joinable() member function.
Syntax
bool joinable() const;
Return Value
- Returns true if the thread can be joined.
- Returns false otherwise.
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
using namespace std;
void task()
{
    cout << "Thread running\n";
}
int main()
{
    thread t(task);
    if (t.joinable())
    {
        t.join();
        cout << "Thread joined\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
Output
Thread running
Thread joined
Explanation
- joinable() checks whether the thread is eligible for joining.
- Since the thread has not been joined or detached, it returns true.
- The thread is then safely joined.
Situations Where a Thread Becomes Non-Joinable
A thread becomes non-joinable in the following situations:
- After it has been joined using join().
- After it has been detached using detach().
- When it is default-constructed without an associated thread.
Advantages of join()
- Ensures the thread completes before the program proceeds.
- Prevents premature program termination while threads are still running.
- Simplifies thread synchronization.
- Helps avoid resource management issues caused by unfinished threads.
Limitations of join()
Despite its advantages, join() has a few limitations:
- Blocks the calling thread until the associated thread finishes execution.
- A thread object can be joined only once during its lifetime.
- Calling join() on a non-joinable thread results in program termination.
- Excessive use of join() may reduce concurrency by making threads wait unnecessarily.
