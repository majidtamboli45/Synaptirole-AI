# References in C++

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp/references-in-cpp/

References in C++ provide a way to create an alternative name for an existing variable. They allow programmers to access and modify the original variable directly without creating a separate copy, making programs more efficient and easier to read.
- A reference acts as an alias for another variable.
- Changes made through a reference affect the original variable.
- References are commonly used in function parameters to improve performance.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int x = 10;
    // ref is a reference to x.
    int& ref = x;
    // printing value using ref
    cout << ref << endl;
    
    // Changing the value and printing again
    ref = 22;
    cout << ref;
    return 0;
}
Output
10
22
Explanation: In this program, ref is a reference to the variable x, meaning ref is just another name for x. When the value of ref is modified, it directly changes the value of x, since both ref and x refer to the same memory location.
If you've worked with pointers before, references may seem similar because both refer to the same memory location. However, references provide a simpler and more readable way to access an existing variable without using *.
Syntax
The & symbol is used to declare a reference.
T &ref = var;
Parameters
- T - Data type of the variable.
- ref - Name of the reference variable.
- var - Existing variable to which the reference is bound.
Here, ref becomes an alias for the variable var.
Important Points About References
- A reference must be initialized at the time of declaration.
- Once initialized, a reference cannot be made to refer to another variable.
- References cannot be null.
- Any modification through a reference directly affects the original variable.
Applications of References
References are widely used in C++ to avoid unnecessary copying and to provide direct access to existing objects. Some common applications are discussed below.
Passing Arguments by Reference
References are commonly used in function arguments to allow modification of the original variable passed to the function. They are also more efficient for large data structures since no copies are made.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
void modifyValue(int &x) {
  
    // Modifies the original variable
    x = 20;  
}
int main() {
    int a = 10;
  
    // Pass a by reference
    modifyValue(a);
    
    cout << a;
    return 0;
}
Output
20
Explanation: The parameter x is a reference to a. Therefore, any modification made to x inside modifyValue() directly changes the value of a. No additional copy of the variable is created.
Returning Reference from Functions
Functions in C++ can return references to variables. This allows the returned value to be accessed or modified directly without creating a copy, making it useful for improving performance and enabling direct updates to existing objects.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int& getMax(int &a, int &b) {
  
    // Return the larger of the two numbers
    return (a > b) ? a : b;  
}
int main() {
    int x = 10, y = 20;
    int &maxVal = getMax(x, y);
  
    // Modify the value of the larger number
    maxVal = 30;  
    cout << "x = " << x << ", y = " << y;
    return 0;
}
Output
x = 10, y = 30
Explanation: The function getMax() returns a reference to the larger of the two variables. Since maxVal is a reference, assigning 30 to it directly modifies the original variable (y in this case). The output becomes x = 10, y = 30.
Note: Never return a reference to a local variable because local variables are destroyed when the function returns, leaving the reference dangling.
Modify Data in Range Based Loops
Range-based for loops normally iterate over elements by value. By using references, you can modify the original elements stored in the container directly.
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    vector<int> vect{ 10, 20, 30, 40 };
    // We can modify elements if we
    // use reference
    for (int& x : vect) {
        x = x + 5;
    }
    // Printing elements
    for (int x : vect) {
        cout << x << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
Output
15 25 35 45 
Explanation: The loop variable x is declared as a reference (int&). Therefore, any modification made to x directly updates the corresponding element in the vector. Each element is increased by 5.
Limitations of References
Although references are convenient and safe to use, they have some limitations:
- A reference must be initialized when it is declared.
- Once initialized, a reference cannot be made to refer to another variable.
- References cannot be nullptr or null.
- References offer less flexibility than pointers in scenarios requiring reassignment.
Advantages of References
References provide several benefits over pointers in many situations:
- Safer: References must be initialized, reducing the chances of uninitialized or wild references.
- Easy to Use: References can be used like ordinary variables without explicit dereferencing.
- Cleaner Syntax: Member functions and variables can be accessed using the dot (.) operator instead of the arrow (->) operator.
- Efficient: Passing large objects by reference avoids unnecessary copying.
