# Memory leak in C++

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp/memory-leak-in-c-and-how-to-avoid-it/

A memory leak occurs when dynamically allocated memory is not released after it is no longer needed. Since the memory remains allocated, it cannot be reused until the program terminates.
- Occurs when dynamically allocated memory is not deallocated.
- Leads to unnecessary memory consumption and reduced available memory.
Example: The following program allocates memory dynamically but never releases it.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
void func() {
    // Allocate memory
    int* ptr = new int[10];
    // Memory is never released
    return;
}
int main() {
    func();
    return 0;
}
Explanation
- new int[10] allocates memory for an array of 10 integers.
- The pointer ptr goes out of scope when func() returns.
- Since delete[] is never called, the allocated memory cannot be accessed or reused, resulting in a memory leak.
Causes of Memory Leaks
Memory leaks occur because C++ does not provide automatic garbage collection for dynamically allocated memory.
- Forgetting to release memory allocated using new.
- Losing the pointer to dynamically allocated memory before deleting it.
- Returning from a function before releasing allocated memory.
- Overwriting a pointer without freeing the previously allocated memory.
Consequences of Memory Leaks
Memory leaks gradually reduce the amount of available memory and may affect both the program and the operating system.
- Reduced Performance: Less memory is available for the program and other applications.
- Program Crashes: Excessive memory usage may cause the program to become unstable or terminate.
- Resource Depletion: Memory remains occupied even though it is no longer required.
- Greater Impact on Long-Running Programs: Applications such as servers and background services continue accumulating leaked memory over time.
Preventing Memory Leaks
Memory leaks can be avoided by properly managing dynamically allocated memory.
- Always pair every new with the corresponding delete or delete[].
- Prefer smart pointers instead of raw pointers whenever possible.
- Use constructors and destructor to manage resources in class (RAII).
- Assign nullptr to pointers after deleting them when appropriate.
- Avoid overwriting pointers without first releasing the previously allocated memory.
Detecting Memory Leaks
Memory leaks can be identified by reviewing code or by using specialized debugging tools.
- Perform careful code reviews to ensure every allocation has a matching deallocation.
- Use tools such as Valgrind, AddressSanitizer (ASan), or IDE memory analyzers to detect leaked memory during program execution.
