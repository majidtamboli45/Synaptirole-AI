# Basic Input / Output in C++

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp/basic-input-output-c/

In C++, data is read and written using streams, which are sequences of bytes.
- Input stream: Data flows from a device (like the keyboard) to the computer’s memory.
- Output stream: Data flows from memory to an output device (like the screen).
- These streams are defined in the <iostream> header file.
- The most common stream objects are - "cin": for taking input and "cout": for displaying output.
Standard Output Stream - cout
- cout is an instance of the ostream class used to display output on the screen.
- Data is sent to cout using the insertion operator <<.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    cout << "GeeksforGeeks";
    return 0;
}
Output
GeeksforGeeks
Standard Input Stream - cin
- cin is an instance of the istream class used to read input from the keyboard.
- The extraction operator >> is used with cin to get data from the input stream and store it in a variable.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int age;
    // Taking input from user and store it in variable
    cin >> age;
    
    // Output the entered age
    cout << "Age entered: " << age;
    return 0;
}
Output
18 (Enter by user)
Age entered: 18
Un-buffered Standard Error Stream - cerr
- cerr is the standard error stream used to display error messages. It is an instance of the ostream class.
- It is an unbuffered output stream used to display error or warning messages immediately, ensuring they appear instantly without any buffering delays like cout
Note: cerr is unbuffered, so its output appears immediately, while cout is buffered and may be delayed. Both can be redirected to files unbuffered does not prevent file output.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    cerr << "An error occurred";
    return 0;
}
Error
An error occurred
Buffered Standard Error Stream - clog
- clog is the standard logging stream used to display error or log messages. It is an instance of the ostream class, like cerr.
- Messages are first stored in a buffer and displayed only when the buffer is full or explicitly flushed using flush() (Buffered output)
- Useful for logging messages that don’t need to appear immediately on the screen.
- Unlike cerr, output from clog may be delayed due to buffering.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    clog << "An error occurred";
    return 0;
}
