# Thread Synchronization in C++

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp/thread-synchronization-in-cpp/

Thread synchronization is the process of coordinating multiple threads so they can safely access shared resources without causing incorrect results or unpredictable behavior. It ensures that only the intended thread performs an operation when required.
- Prevents multiple threads from modifying shared resources simultaneously.
- Helps avoid concurrency issues such as race conditions and deadlocks.
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
using namespace std;
int counter = 0;
void increment() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++)
        counter++;
}
int main() {
    thread t1(increment);
    thread t2(increment);
    t1.join();
    t2.join();
    cout << counter << endl;
}
Output
138533
Explanation: Both threads update the shared variable simultaneously without synchronization, causing lost updates and unpredictable output. This is known as a race condition.
Need for Thread Synchronization
When multiple threads access shared resources simultaneously without proper coordination, the execution order becomes unpredictable and may lead to incorrect results.
- Prevents simultaneous modification of shared data.
- Ensures operations execute in a controlled order.
- Avoids inconsistent or incorrect results.
- Maintains data integrity in multithreaded programs.
Example
- Initial balance = ₹300
- One thread deposits ₹400.
- Another thread withdraws ₹500.
If the withdrawal executes first, it may fail even though the deposit would have made the balance sufficient.
Common Problems Without Synchronization
Improper synchronization can lead to several concurrency issues:
- Race Condition - Multiple threads modify shared data simultaneously, producing unpredictable results.
- Deadlock - Threads wait indefinitely for resources held by each other.
- Starvation - A thread waits indefinitely because other threads continuously receive priority.
- Data Corruption - Shared data becomes inconsistent due to concurrent modifications.
Thread Synchronization Techniques
C++ provides several synchronization mechanisms for safely coordinating multiple threads.
Mutex
A mutex (mutual exclusion) ensures that only one thread can access a critical section at a time. Other threads attempting to acquire the same mutex must wait until it is released.
- Prevents simultaneous access to shared resources.
- Commonly used to eliminate race conditions.
- Implemented using std::mutex.
Example: The following program demonstrates thread synchronization using a mutex.
#include <iostream>
#include <mutex>
#include <thread>
using namespace std;
// shared lock
double val = 0;
// mutex lock
mutex m;
int cnt = 0;
void add(double num)
{
    m.lock();
    val += num;
    cnt++;
    cout << "Thread " << cnt << ": " << val << endl;
    m.unlock();
}
// driver code
int main()
{
    thread t1(add, 300);
    thread t2(add, 600);
    t1.join();
    t2.join();
    cout << "After addition : " << val << endl;
    return 0;
}
Output
Thread 1: 300
Thread 2: 900
After addition : 900
Explanation: The mutex allows only one thread to execute the critical section at a time, preventing concurrent updates to the shared variable.
Condition Variable
A condition variable allows one thread to wait until another thread notifies that a particular condition has become true. It is usually used together with a mutex.
- Enables threads to wait efficiently.
- Supports thread notification using notify_one() and notify_all().
- Implemented using std::condition_variable.
Example: The following program demonstrates synchronization using a condition variable.
#include <condition_variable>
#include <iostream>
#include <mutex>
#include <thread>
using namespace std;
// condition variable and mutex lock
condition_variable cv;
mutex m;
// shared resource
int val = 0;
void add(int num)
{
    lock_guard<mutex> lock(m);
    val += num;
    cout << "After addition: " << val << endl;
    cv.notify_one();
}
void sub(int num)
{
    unique_lock<mutex> ulock(m);
    cv.wait(ulock,
            [] { return (val != 0) ? true : false; });
    if (val >= num) {
        val -= num;
        cout << "After subtraction: " << val << endl;
    }
    else {
        cout << "Cannot Subtract now!" << endl;
    }
    cout << "Total number Now: " << val << endl;
}
// driver code
int main()
{
    thread t2(sub, 600);
    thread t1(add, 900);
    t1.join();
    t2.join();
    return 0;
}
Output
After addition: 900
After subtraction: 300
Total number Now: 300
Explanation: The waiting thread remains blocked until the required condition becomes true, after which it resumes execution.
Promise and Future
std::promise and std::future provide a mechanism for safely passing data between threads. A promise stores a value, while the corresponding future retrieves it.
- Used for one-time communication between threads.
- Avoids explicit synchronization in many scenarios.
- Implemented using <future>.
Example: The following program demonstrates synchronization using promises and futures.
#include <future>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
using namespace std;
// callable
void EvenNosFind(promise<int>&& EvenPromise, int begin,
                 int end)
{
    int evenNo = 0;
    for (int i = begin; i <= end; i++) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            evenNo += 1;
        }
    }
    EvenPromise.set_value(evenNo);
}
// driver code
int main()
{
    int begin = 0, end = 1000;
    promise<int> evenNo;
    future<int> evenFuture = evenNo.get_future();
    cout << "My thread is created !!!" << endl;
    thread t1(EvenNosFind, move(evenNo), begin, end);
    cout << "Waiting..........." << endl;
    // detting the data
    cout << "The no. of even numbers are : "
         << evenFuture.get() << endl;
    t1.join();
    return 0;
}
Output
My thread is created !!!
Waiting...........
The no. of even numbers are : 501
Explanation: The worker thread stores the computed value in the promise, and the main thread retrieves it through the future using get().
Advantages of Thread Synchronization
Thread synchronization offers several benefits:
- Prevents race conditions and data corruption.
- Improves reliability of multithreaded programs.
- Enables safe communication between threads.
Limitations of Thread Synchronization
Despite its benefits, synchronization also has some drawbacks:
- May reduce parallelism due to thread waiting.
- Incorrect synchronization can cause deadlocks.
- Makes multithreaded programs more complex to design and debug.
