Docker is a tool that simplifies the process of developing, packaging, and deploying applications. It solves the “works on my machine” problem by ensuring code runs identically across environments.
- Docker allows you to build, package, and run applications inside containers
- Containers are lightweight piece of software that contains all the code, libraries, and dependencies that the application needs to run.
- Containers share the host operating system’s kernel but keep applications and their dependencies isolated. This makes containers faster to start, less resource-hungry, and portable across environments.
Docker Introduction
Before starting with Docker, we first need to set up docker on our system and run a simple program to verify the installation
Docker Commands
Docker provides a set of commands that let you build, manage, and run containers easily:
Dockerfile and Images
A Dockerfile is a simple text file with instructions that tell Docker how to build an image, such as which software to install and how the app should run.
Docker Hub
Docker Hub is Docker’s official cloud-based registry where developers store, share, and download Docker images. It acts like a central library of pre-built images — for example, you can pull images of databases (MySQL, MongoDB), programming languages (Python, Node.js), or even full applications.
- What is Docker Hub?
- Log in to Docker for Pulling and Pushing Images
- Docker - Publishing Images to Docker Hub
Docker Compose
Docker Compose is a tool that lets you run and manage multiple Docker containers together as a single application. Instead of starting each container manually, you define all services (like app, database, cache) in a docker-compose.yml file with their configurations.  
Docker Engine and Storage
Docker Engine, also known as Docker Daemon, is the core component of the Docker platform responsible for running and managing Docker containers. Explore this section to get all details about Docker Engine:
- Docker Storage
- Docker Data Storage
- Backup Docker Container
- Manage Volumes using CLI (command line interface)
Docker Networking
Docker Networking refers to the set of mechanisms and technologies Docker provides for communication between Docker containers, as well as between containers and the outside world. Go through this section to get more details about Docker Networking:
Docker Registry
After learning the Docker Networking, in this Docker tutorial, we are going to discuss Docker Registry which is refer as central repository for storing the and managing Docker image.
Docker Volumes
Docker Volumes are a way to store data outside of a container’s filesystem so that the data isn’t lost when the container stops or is deleted. By default, anything you create inside a container is temporary, but with volumes, you can keep files (like databases, logs, or configs) in a safe and reusable location managed by Docker.
Docker Swarm
Docker Swarm is Docker’s native tool for clustering and orchestrating multiple containers. It lets you group several Docker hosts (servers) into a single cluster, called a swarm, and run containers across them as if they were one system.

Docker Vs Kubernetes
- Docker -> creates and runs containers.
- Kubernetes -> manages and orchestrates containers at scale.
Docker
- A platform to build, package, and run applications inside lightweight containers.
- Provides Docker Engine for running containers and Docker Hub for sharing images.
- Focuses on the creation and management of individual containers.
- Best suited for single-node containerized applications or small-scale deployments.
- Includes Docker Compose for running multi-container applications, but lacks advanced orchestration features.
Kubernetes
- A container orchestration system used to manage, scale, and automate deployment of containers across multiple machines.
- Works with Docker containers (and others like containerd, CRI-O).
- Handles load balancing, service discovery, auto-scaling, rolling updates, and self-healing of containers.
- Best suited for large-scale, distributed applications running in production.
- Provides a full ecosystem for managing clusters, not just single containerA Docker Image is the packaged output of that Dockerfile, containing the app code and all dependencies. Containers are then created from these images to run the application consistently on any system.
