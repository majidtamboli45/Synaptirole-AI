# Docker Registry

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/devops/what-is-docker-registry/

Docker Registry is a centralized storage and distributed system for collecting and managing Docker images. It acts as a server-side application that stores, manages, and distributes container images across environments. It is an essential component in the containerization workflow for streamlining the deployment and management of applications. Features of a Docker Registry are :
- Stateless and scalable
- Organized into repositories, where each repository contains multiple versions (tags) of an image.
- Accessible to users for pushing (uploading) and pulling (downloading) images.
- Docker Image : A Docker Image is a template (blueprint) used to create Docker Containers.
- Docker Images Registry : A Docker Registry is a storage system where Docker Images are pushed (uploaded) and pulled (downloaded).
- Docker Hub : It is the official cloud-based Docker Registry service provided by Docker Inc. It is the default registry where Docker looks for images when you run docker pull or docker run without specifying a registry.
- Docker Login : It is a Docker CLI command used to authenticate your local Docker client with a Docker Registry (like Docker Hub, AWS ECR, GCP GCR, Azure ACR, or a private registry). It allows you to push (upload) and pull (download) Docker images securely by verifying your username and password or access token.
- Authentication of Dockerhub : Authentication in Docker Hub ensures secure pushing and pulling of Docker images, especially when dealing with private repositories and DevOps pipelines.
Different Types of Docker Registries
- Cloud-Hosted / Public Registries: These are managed services that are easy to use and integrate with other cloud platforms.
- Docker Hub: The default and largest public registry, hosting millions of official and community images.
- Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR): AWS's managed registry, integrated with its cloud ecosystem.
- Google Artifact Registry (GAR): Google Cloud's recommended registry for container images and other artifacts. (Note: Google Container Registry (GCR) is deprecated).
- Azure Container Registry (ACR): Microsoft's registry service for its Azure platform.
- GitLab Container Registry: Integrated directly into the GitLab CI/CD platform.
- Private / Self-Hosted Registries: These are registries you run on your own infrastructure for maximum control, security, and speed.
- Docker Registry Image: Docker provides an official open-source image (registry:2) that allows you to run a basic registry yourself.
- Harbor: An open-source, enterprise-grade registry with advanced features like vulnerability scanning and role-based access control.
Basic commands for Docker registry
The following are the basic commands for Docker registry:
1. Starting your registry
- This command effectively starts a Docker registry on your local machine or server, accessible via port 5000.
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart=always --name registry registry:2
- It instructs Docker to start a registry named registry:2 in detached mode with the name registry. Map the registry's port 5000 to a local port 5000 and restart it immediately if it dies.
2. Pulling some images from the hub
- The following is the command used for pulling the image from the public docker registry, Here we pulling the ubuntu image.
docker pull ubuntu:latest
3. Tagging that image and point to your registry
- The following command is used for tagging the image and point to your registry:
docker image tag ubuntu:latest localhost:5000/gfg-image
4. Pushing the image
- This command pushes the image to the local registry running on localhost:5000 .
docker push localhost:5000/gfg-image
5. Pulling that image back
- This command instructs Docker to pull the image named gfg-image from the local registry running on localhost at port 5000.
docker pull localhost:5000/gfg-image
6. Stop the registry
- This command instructs Docker to stop the container named registry:
docker container stop registry
7. Stop the registry and remove the data
- The following is the command is used for stopping the registry and remove the associated data effectively:
docker container stop registry && docker container rm -v registry
Docker Registry Working
A Docker Registry stores and distributes Docker images. Users can push images to the registry and pull them when needed.
- Docker Registry provides a storage and distribution platform for Docker images.
- Users can upload their Docker images to the registry, and these images can be tagged with a version number and a name.
- Other users can then search for and download these images from the registry.
- Docker Registry can be self-hosted or used as a cloud-based service.
- Docker Registry helps the administrators to implement access controls and permissions ensuring only authorized users and systems.
- Docker Registry facilitates with seamless integration through Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
Registries Importantance
Docker registries are a cornerstone of modern software development for several key reasons:
- CI/CD Automation: Registries are the bridge in CI/CD pipelines. A CI process builds a new image and pushes it to the registry; a CD process then pulls that image to deploy it to staging or production environments.
- Centralized Management & Collaboration: They provide a single source of truth for all container images, making it easy for teams to share and collaborate on applications.
- Version Control: By using tags, registries allow you to version your images, ensuring you can track changes and roll back to previous versions if needed.
- Enhanced Security: Private registries give you full control over who can access your images. Many hosted registries also offer built-in vulnerability scanning to detect security issues before deployment.
