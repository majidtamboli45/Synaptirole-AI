PostgreSQL is a free and open-source database management system used to store, organize and manage data efficiently. It is one of the most popular databases because it is reliable, secure and can handle large amounts of data.
- Supports SQL queries to store, retrieve and manage data.
- Allows transactions to keep data accurate and consistent.
- Supports JSON and JSONB data for modern applications.
- Uses Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) to allow many users to work with the database at the same time.
- Can be extended with custom data types, functions and extensions.
Note: Before learning PostgreSQL, it is recommended to have basic knowledge of SQL concepts.
Writing Your First SQL Query in PostgreSQL
Below is an example to display “Hello, World!” using SQL:
1. Create a database
CREATE DATABASE test_db;
2. Connect to the database
\c test_db;
3. Create a table
CREATE TABLE greetings (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
message VARCHAR(255)
);
4. Insert a message
INSERT INTO greetings (message)
VALUES ('Hello, World!');
5. Retrieve the message
SELECT message FROM greetings;

Basics
Learn the fundamental concepts of PostgreSQL, including installation, setup and the basic building blocks needed to work with databases.
Database Management
Databases help organize and store data. This section covers the essential operations used to manage databases in PostgreSQL.
Table Management
Tables are used to store data in rows and columns. This section explains how to create and manage tables effectively.
Querying & Filtering Data
Learn how to retrieve, filter, sort and analyze data using PostgreSQL queries.
Set Operators
Set operators help combine or compare the results of multiple queries.
Subqueries
Subqueries in PostgreSQL allow queries to be nested inside another query, making it easier to perform complex filtering and data retrieval operations.
Modifying Data
Data modification in PostgreSQL helps insert new records, update existing data, delete rows and perform upsert operations efficiently.
Conditionals & Control Flow
Conditional and control statements in PostgreSQL help manage decision-making, looping and logical operations within queries and procedural code.
Constraints
Constraints in PostgreSQL ensure data accuracy and integrity by restricting invalid or duplicate data from being stored in tables.
JOINS & Schemas
Joins in PostgreSQL combine data from multiple tables, while schemas help organize and manage database objects efficiently.
Roles & Permissions
Roles and permissions in PostgreSQL control user access and database security by managing privileges and role-based operations.
In-Built Functions
PostgreSQL in-built functions simplify calculations, string manipulation, date handling and data processing operations within queries.
Indexes
Indexes in PostgreSQL improve query performance by allowing faster data retrieval and efficient searching on database tables.
Advanced PostgreSQL
Advanced PostgreSQL concepts help you work with procedures, triggers, transactions, exception handling and other important database features.
Exercises & Interview Questions
PostgreSQL exercises and interview questions help strengthen practical knowledge and prepare for real-world database development and job interviews.
