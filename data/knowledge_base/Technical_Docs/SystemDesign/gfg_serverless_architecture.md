# Serverless Architecture

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/serverless-architectures

Serverless Architecture is a cloud computing model where the cloud provider manages the underlying infrastructure, including server provisioning, scaling, and maintenance. This allows developers to focus on writing and deploying application code.
- Code runs automatically in response to events or requests.
- The cloud provider handles server management, scaling, and resource allocation.
Example: When a user uploads an image, a serverless function automatically processes the image without requiring developers to manage any servers.
Serverless Computing Providers and Platforms
Serverless computing has become a key focus for cloud providers, offering platforms tailored to different development needs.
- AWS Lambda: AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that allows developers to run code without managing servers. It automatically scales applications and executes code in response to events from AWS services and external applications.
- Azure Functions: Azure Functions is Microsoft's serverless platform for running event-driven code without infrastructure management. It integrates seamlessly with Azure services and supports multiple programming languages.
- Google Cloud Functions: Google Cloud Functions enables developers to build and deploy event-driven applications without managing servers. Google automatically handles infrastructure, scaling, and resource allocation.
- Oracle Cloud Functions: Oracle Cloud Functions is a serverless platform that executes functions in response to HTTP requests or cloud events. It integrates with Oracle Cloud services to simplify application development and deployment.
Serverless Application Design Patterns
Serverless architecture has introduced a variety of design patterns that help solve specific problems in the serverless environment efficiently. Here are some of the most common serverless application design patterns:
API Gateway Pattern (Serverless Integration)
A serverless function acts as a gateway to route incoming requests to backend services.
- Handles HTTP requests, performs initial processing, and forwards them to appropriate services.
- Commonly used to build lightweight API gateways.
Event Stream Processing
Responding to data streams like logs, financial transactions, or social media feeds is a good fit for serverless functions.
- In this architecture, streams of events trigger functions that process each event separately.
- This is helpful in situations like logging, real-time data analytics, and processing data from the Internet of Things.
Aggregator
A serverless function aggregates data from multiple services or functions.
- Collects and combines responses from different sources.
- Returns a unified response, often used in microservices-based systems.
Strangler Fig Pattern
This pattern helps migrate legacy systems to serverless gradually.
- New features are implemented using serverless functions.
- Legacy components are slowly replaced without a full rewrite.
Circuit Breaker
The circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures in a serverless system by stopping repeated failed function calls.
- Breaks the function invocation chain after a predefined failure threshold.
- Allows the system to continue operating in a degraded but stable state.
Scaling and Performance Considerations
Scaling and performance are crucial in serverless architectures, enabling applications to handle varying loads automatically without manual intervention.
1. Scaling in Serverless Computing
Scaling in serverless computing automatically adjusts resources based on incoming workload without manual intervention.
- Automatic Scaling: Serverless platforms automatically scale the execution units (functions) based on the incoming request or event rate.
- Cold Starts: Cold starts occur when a new function instance is initialized after being idle. This can introduce latency and affect the response time of serverless applications.
- Throttling: Cloud providers impose limits on function invocations to prevent resource overuse. If requests exceed these limits, throttling may occur, causing delayed processing.
2. Performance Optimization Strategies
Performance optimization strategies focus on reducing latency and improving execution efficiency in serverless applications.
- Optimize Function Code: Keeping the function code lean and efficient is vital. This includes minimizing dependencies and using asynchronous programming models where appropriate.
- Manage Dependencies: Reduce the size of deployment packages by removing unused libraries and files. Smaller packages help decrease initialization and startup times.
- Persistent Connections: Use persistent connections when interacting with databases or external services. This reduces connection setup overhead and improves execution efficiency.
Security Best Practices for Serverless Architectures
Here are some best practices to enhance security in serverless environments:
1. Least Privilege Principle
Grant only the minimum permissions required for each serverless function. This reduces the impact of security breaches and unauthorized access.
- Provide only the permissions needed to perform specific tasks.
- Limits potential damage if a function is compromised.
2. Secure Application Secrets
Sensitive data should never be exposed directly in code or configuration.
- Avoid hard-coding API keys, tokens, or credentials.
- Use managed secret services (e.g., cloud secret managers).
3. Input Validation
Validating input helps protect serverless functions from common attacks.
- Prevents SQL injection, XSS, and command injection.
- Especially important as functions often access databases directly.
4. Secure API Gateway
Configure API gateways with proper security controls to protect serverless endpoints and services.
- Use authentication methods such as OAuth, API keys, or IAM.
- Enable rate limiting and CORS policies to secure APIs.
5. Encryption
Turn on encryption both in transit and at rest.
- Encrypt database connections, use HTTPS for serverless APIs, and make sure data storage providers are set up to encrypt data while it's in storage.
- By doing this, data exposure to unauthorized parties is less likely to occur.
Use Cases
Some of the use cases of Serverless Architecture are:
- Chatbots and Virtual Assistants: Serverless architecture enables the development of chatbots and virtual assistants that respond to user requests through messaging or voice interfaces. It automatically scales based on user demand.
- Real-Time Data Processing: Serverless functions can process streaming data in real time for analytics, monitoring, and alert generation. This eliminates the need to manage dedicated processing servers.
- Web and Mobile Backends: Serverless platforms provide scalable backends for web and mobile applications. They can handle authentication, API requests, and database operations efficiently.
- Scheduled Tasks and Cron Jobs: Serverless functions can run automatically on predefined schedules. They are commonly used for backups, report generation, data synchronization, and maintenance tasks.
Challenges
Challenges of Serverless Architecture are:
- Cold Start Latency: Serverless functions may experience startup delays when invoked after being idle. This can increase response time for infrequently used functions.
- Limited Execution Environment: Serverless platforms impose limits on memory, execution time, and available resources. These restrictions may not suit all application workloads.
- Debugging and Monitoring Complexity: Monitoring and debugging distributed serverless functions can be challenging. Specialized tools are often required to track and troubleshoot issues effectively.
- State Management: Since serverless functions are stateless, application state must be stored in external databases or storage services. This can increase design complexity.
- Security and Compliance Challenges: Managing access control, securing function endpoints, and meeting compliance requirements can be more complex in serverless environments.
