# Types of Load Balancer

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/types-of-load-balancer

Load Balancers distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure optimal resource utilization, minimize response time, and prevent server overload. They can be implemented in different ways depending on infrastructure and scalability needs.
- Run on standard servers or operating systems, offering flexibility and cost-effectiveness, including cloud-based or virtual appliances for easy scalability and deployment.
- Dedicated physical devices designed specifically for high performance and reliability.
Example: A popular e-commerce platform might use a hardware load balancer for on-premises traffic, a software load balancer for internal microservices, and a virtual load balancer in the cloud to handle seasonal spikes.
Types of Load Balancer
Load balancers can be classified based on their configuration and the way they handle network traffic.
Based on Configurations
These load balancers are categorized according to how they are set up and managed in a system. They define whether traffic distribution is handled by hardware, software, or cloud-based configurations.
1. Software Load Balancers: Software load balancers are applications or components that run on general-purpose servers. They are implemented in software, making them flexible and adaptable to various environments.
- The application chooses the first one in the list and requests data from the server.
- If any failure occurs persistently (after a configurable number of retries) and the server becomes unavailable, it discards that server and chooses the other one from the list to continue the process.
- This is one of the cheapest ways to implement load balancing.
Example: NGINX, HAProxy.
- Pros: Flexible, cost-effective, easy to deploy on standard servers.
- Cons: Limited performance compared to dedicated hardware; depends on underlying server resources.
2. Hardware Load Balancers: As the name suggests we use a physical appliance to distribute the traffic across the cluster of network servers. These load balancers are also known as Layer 4-7 Routers and these are capable of handling all kinds of HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, and UDP traffic.
- HLBs can handle a large volume of traffic but it comes with a hefty price tag and it also has limited flexibility.
- If any of the servers don’t produce the desired response, it immediately stops sending the traffic to the servers.
- These load balancers are expensive to acquire and configure, which is the reason a lot of service providers use them only as the first entry point for user requests.
- Later the internal software load balancers are used to redirect the data behind the infrastructure wall.
Example: F5 BIG-IP, Citrix ADC.
- Pros: High performance, handles large traffic volumes, very reliable.
- Cons: Expensive and less flexible; requires physical setup and maintenance.
3. Virtual Load Balancers: A virtual load balancer is a software-based solution (running as a VM) that distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers. It helps improve performance, optimize resource usage, and prevent server overload.
Example: AWS Elastic Load Balancer, Kemp Virtual LoadMaster.
- Pros: Scalable, easy to deploy in cloud or virtual environments; combines flexibility and performance.
- Cons: Performance depends on the underlying virtual infrastructure; may require licensing costs.
Based on Functions
These load balancers are classified by the way they manage and distribute network traffic. They operate at different layers (network, transport, or application) to ensure efficient request handling and high availability.
1. Layer 4 (L4) Load Balancer/Network Load Balancer: Layer-4 load balancers operate at the transport layer of the OSI model. They make forwarding decisions based on information available in network layer protocols (such as IP addresses and port numbers).
Examples:
- HAProxy (configured in TCP mode for L4)
- F5 BIG-IP (Layer 4 TCP/UDP load balancing)
- Pros: Fast and efficient; low latency because it works at the transport layer.
- Cons: Cannot make content-based routing decisions; limited intelligence.
Features
These load balancers focus on fast and efficient traffic distribution at the network level.
- Transport Layer: Operates at the transport layer (TCP/UDP).
- Basic Load Balancing: Distributes traffic based on IP addresses and port numbers.
- Efficiency: Faster processing as it doesn’t inspect the content of the data packets.
- Network Address Translation (NAT): Can perform basic NAT to hide server addresses.
2. Layer 7 (L7) Load Balancer/Application Load Balancer: Layer-7 load balancers operate at the application layer of the OSI model. They can make load balancing decisions based on content, including information such as URLs, HTTP headers, or cookies.
Examples:
- NGINX (HTTP/HTTPS reverse proxy and content-based routing)
- AWS Application Load Balancer (routes traffic based on URLs, headers, cookies)
- Pros: Content-aware; can route based on URLs, headers, cookies, or SSL.
- Cons: Slower than L4 due to deeper packet inspection; higher resource usage.
Features
These load balancers provide intelligent and content-aware traffic distribution.
- Content-Based Routing: Distributes traffic based on content-specific information.
- Advanced Routing: Can make intelligent routing decisions based on application-specific data.
- SSL Termination: Capable of terminating SSL connections.
3. GSLB (Global Server Load Balancer): GSLB stands for Global Server Load Balancer, also known as Multi-site Load Balancer. This type of load balancer goes beyond the traditional local load balancing and is designed for distributing traffic across multiple data centers or geographically distributed servers.
Examples:
- Cloudflare Load Balancing (geo-routing and failover across multiple regions)
- AWS Route 53 with latency-based routing (directs users to the lowest-latency endpoint)
- Pros: Improves global performance by routing users to the closest or healthiest data center.
- Cons: Complex to configure; dependent on accurate health checks and DNS propagation.
Features
A GSLB focuses on global or wide-area traffic management to improve availability and performance.
- Proximity-Based Routing: Directs users to the nearest or lowest-latency server location.
- Health Awareness: Monitors server health and avoids sending traffic to unhealthy regions.
- Geographic Intelligence: Considers location and performance factors to route traffic intelligently.
