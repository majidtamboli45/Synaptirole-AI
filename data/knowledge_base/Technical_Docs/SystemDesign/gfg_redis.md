# Redis Introduction

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/introduction-to-redis-server

Redis (Remote Dictionary Server) is an in-memory database that stores data in RAM for very fast access. It is mainly used for caching and reducing the load on the main database.
- Stores frequently accessed data for faster retrieval and better application performance.
- Used for sessions, queues, leaderboards, and real-time analytics.
Example: An e-commerce website can use Redis to cache product details so users can load product pages much faster.
Real-World Applications
Redis is widely used by large-scale applications to handle high-speed data access, real-time processing, and efficient caching.
- Amazon & Flipkart: Use Redis to cache product details, prices, and user sessions, ensuring fast page loads and smooth checkout during high traffic sales.
- Netflix: Uses Redis for caching frequently accessed content data and managing real-time user sessions to deliver a seamless streaming experience.
- Facebook & Instagram: Use Redis to handle real-time notifications, feeds, and user activity for fast and responsive interactions.
- Uber: Uses Redis for real-time location tracking, ride matching, and surge pricing calculations.
Working
Redis acts as a caching layer between the database and the client to speed up data access and reduce the load on the main database. When a client asks for data, the API Gateway forwards the request to Redis.
- Request Handling: The client request is routed through the API Gateway, which first checks Redis for the required data.
- Cache Hit: If the data exists in Redis, it is returned immediately without accessing the database.
- Cache Miss: If the data is not found in Redis, the request is forwarded to the main database.
- Cache Update: The data retrieved from the database is stored in Redis for future requests.
- Response to Client: The API Gateway sends the final response to the client using data from Redis or the database.
Example: When a user visits a popular product page, Redis serves the cached product information instantly instead of querying the database every time.
Before starting to learn Redis, we need to install redis on our system.
import redis
r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
r.set('name', 'Alia')
print(r.get('name').decode('utf-8'))  
r.set('name', 'Riya')
print(r.get('name').decode('utf-8')) 
r.delete('name')
print(r.get('name'))  
Output
Understand the above example:
import redis
This line imports the redis Python library, which allows you to talk to a Redis server from your Python code.
r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
This line creates a connection to the Redis server.
- host='localhost': Connects to the Redis server running on your local machine.
- port=6379: Uses the default port on which Redis listens for connections.
- db=0: Connects to Redis logical database 0. Redis supports multiple logical databases numbered from 0 onward.
The variable r acts as a Redis client object that can be used to perform various Redis operations.
r.set('name', 'Alia')
This statement stores a key-value pair in Redis.
- Key: name
- Value: Alia
After execution, Redis stores the data as:
name -> Alia
This line stores the key name with the value Alia in Redis. 
print(r.get('name').decode('utf-8'))
This statement retrieves and displays the value associated with the key name.
- r.get('name') fetches the value from Redis.
- Redis returns data in bytes format, such as b'Alia'.
- .decode('utf-8') converts the bytes into a readable string.
- The output displayed on the console is:
Note: In this example, Redis is integrated with Python but redis can also be implemented in other programming languages like Java, JavaScript (Node.js), Go, Ruby, C# (.NET), PHP, and many more, using their respective Redis client libraries.
Use Cases of Redis
Redis is used when applications need very fast access to temporary or frequently used data, reducing repeated queries to the main database.
- Caching: Stores frequently accessed data for faster retrieval and improved performance.
- Session Management: Stores user login and session information for quick access.
- Real-time Applications: Supports leaderboards, queues, notifications, and chat systems with fast updates.
Example: In a messaging application, Redis can store the last few messages of a conversation using its list data structure so that users can quickly see recent messages without repeatedly querying the main database.
Factors That Make Redis Fast
Redis is fast because it stores data in RAM and uses an efficient architecture for quick data processing.
- In-Memory Storage: Stores data in RAM for faster read and write operations.
- Single-Threaded Event Loop: Avoids thread management and context-switching overhead.
- Efficient Data Structures: Uses optimized lists, sets, hashes, and sorted sets.
- Lightweight Protocol: Uses RESP for fast client-server communication.
Example: When an application requests cached product data from Redis, the response can be returned in microseconds, whereas querying a disk-based database may take milliseconds.
