# CDN Vs Edge Server

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/cdn-vs-edge-server-system-design

CDNs and edge servers both improve performance by bringing data closer to users. CDNs focus on fast content delivery, while edge servers also handle processing near the user.
- CDNs mainly deliver static and frequently accessed content from distributed servers, reducing latency and server load.
- Edge servers not only store data but also process requests closer to users, enabling faster and real-time responses.
CDN (Content Delivery Network)
A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers placed across different locations to deliver web content and services efficiently. Its main goal is to reduce latency by serving data from a server closer to the user, minimizing the distance data travels.
- CDNs cache static assets like images, videos, stylesheets, and scripts, ensuring faster load times for users around the world. CDNs are commonly used to improve website performance, reduce server load, and enhance the overall user experience.
- Popular CDNs include Cloudflare, Akamai, and AWS CloudFront.
Advantages
CDNs improve performance and reliability by delivering content closer to users.
- Content is served from the nearest location, reducing latency.
- Caching reduces the need for multiple requests to the origin server.
- CDNs often have redundancy, ensuring the website is available even if some servers are down.
Disadvantages
CDNs come with cost and complexity, especially for dynamic content handling.
- CDNs can be expensive, especially for large-scale usage.
- Managing content updates can be complex when cached at different locations.
- CDNs are better suited for static content like images, CSS, or videos.
Edge Server
An edge server is located at the edge of a network, closer to end users or devices, to process data, perform compute tasks, and store content. Its main purpose is to reduce latency by handling tasks locally, minimizing the need to send data back and forth to distant data centers.
- Edge servers are often used for real-time data processing, IoT applications, and localized content delivery, enhancing performance and user experience.
- They play a key role in edge computing, where computation happens near the data source.
Advantages
Edge computing improves performance by processing data closer to users.
- Edge servers are closer to the user, minimizing delay.
- By processing data at the edge, it reduces the load on centralized data centers.
- With edge servers, systems can handle more users without overwhelming central resources.
Disadvantages
Edge computing introduces complexity, cost, and security challenges.
- Setting up and maintaining multiple edge servers can be challenging.
- Decentralizing data introduces new security risks at multiple locations.
- Edge computing infrastructure can be costly to implement and manage.
CDN Architecture
A CDN is not a single server but a global network of distributed edge servers. Multiple CDN providers operate in the same country, and each CDN consists of many edge servers located across different cities to serve users efficiently.
- CDN: Company/Network (like Cloudflare, Akamai, Amazon CloudFront)
- Edge Servers: Physical servers inside that CDN
Example (India): Cloudflare: many edge servers in Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore
CDN Vs Edge Server
Below the difference between CDN and Edge Server:
| CDN | Edge Server | 
|---|---|
| Reduces latency for static content | Reduces latency for processing & dynamic data | 
| Distributes content globally | Processes data near users | 
| Globally distributed servers | Located close to users/devices | 
| Best for static content (images, videos) | Best for real-time processing (IoT, apps) | 
| Mainly caching & delivery | Can process and analyze data | 
| Subscription-based pricing | High setup & maintenance cost |
