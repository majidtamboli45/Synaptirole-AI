# Stateful Vs Stateless Architecture

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/stateful-vs-stateless-architecture

Stateful vs Stateless Architecture defines how a system manages client session data during interactions. It impacts scalability, performance, and system design.
- Stateful: Server stores session data across multiple requests.
- Stateless: Each request is independent with no stored session.
- Usage: Stateless is preferred for scalable and distributed systems.
Stateful Architecture
The server maintains the state or session information of each client. This means that the server keeps track of the client's data and context throughout multiple interactions or requests.
- Often involve storing session data in server memory, databases, or other storage mechanisms.
- Examples include traditional web applications that use server-side sessions to store user data or shopping cart contents.
Example: An online shopping website where the server stores a user’s login session and shopping cart. If the user adds items to the cart, the server remembers those items during the session.
Stateless Architecture
The server does not store any client session information between requests. Each request from the client is treated as an independent transaction.
- To maintain user sessions, stateless architectures often use techniques like JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or client-side cookies to store session data
- Designed to be more scalable and fault-tolerant because they do not require server resources to maintain client state.
- Examples include RESTful APIs, where each request contains all the necessary information for the server to process it independently.
Example: A REST API for a mobile app where each request includes an authentication token (JWT). The server verifies the token and processes the request without storing session information.
Stateful Vs Stateless Architecture
Below are the differences between stateful and stateless architecture:
| Stateful Architecture | Stateless Architecture | 
|---|---|
| Scaling requires synchronization of session data. | Horizontal scaling is straightforward. | 
| Failure in one server can affect sessions stored on it. | Failures are isolated, impacting only individual requests. | 
| May experience increased latency due to session management. | Typically faster response times due to lack of session overhead. | 
| Requires more resources to store and manage session state. | Uses resources efficiently because no session state is stored. | 
| Caching can be complex due to session-specific data. | Caching is simpler since requests are independent. | 
| Deployment can be complex because session data must be synchronized. | Deployment and maintenance are easier due to stateless nature. | 
| Maintains session context to ensure transaction continuity. | Transactions are handled independently at the request level. | 
| Load balancing may require session affinity (sticky sessions). | Load balancing is simpler since any server can handle any request. | 
| Developers must manage session handling and related issues. | Developers can focus mainly on business logic without session concerns. | 
Benefits of Stateful Architecture
Stateful architecture provides several advantages when applications need to maintain user sessions and context across multiple requests.
- Session Persistence: Maintains user sessions, allowing smooth transitions across steps or devices.
- Efficient Resource Use: Stores session data on the server, reducing repeated transfers and processing.
- Personalization: Uses past interactions to deliver tailored experiences, like recommendations.
- Enhanced Security: Centralized session management supports strong authentication and encryption.
Benefits of Stateless Architecture
Stateless architecture offers advantages in scalability and simplicity because each request is handled independently.
- High Scalability: Easily handles large numbers of requests without session management.
- Fault Tolerance: Each request is independent, so failures in one area don’t affect others.
- Simplified Load Balancing: Requests can be evenly distributed without sticky sessions.
- Better Performance: No session overhead, resulting in faster responses and lower latency.
