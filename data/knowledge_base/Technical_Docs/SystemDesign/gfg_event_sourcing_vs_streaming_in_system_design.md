# Event Sourcing Vs Event Streaming in System Design

Event Sourcing and Event Streaming are two fundamental concepts in modern system design that address how data is captured, stored, and processed. Event Sourcing stores application state as a sequence of immutable events, while Event Streaming focuses on the continuous real-time flow and processing of events between systems.
Event Sourcing
Event Sourcing is a software architectural pattern where the state of an application is derived from a sequence of immutable events rather than storing only the current state. It captures every state change as an event to maintain a complete history of the system.
- Stores each change as an immutable event instead of updating only the current state, enabling full traceability and auditing.
- Allows state reconstruction by replaying events, making debugging and history tracking easier and more reliable.
Advantages
Event sourcing provides a complete record of all actions, making it easier to understand and recover system state.
- You have a full history of everything that happened in the system.
- You can easily fix mistakes by reprocessing events.
- It is easy to see how the current state was reached.
Disadvantages
While powerful, event sourcing can become complex and resource-intensive if not managed carefully.
- Managing events can become complex over time.
- It stores every event and can use a lot of space.
- Rebuilding the current state from many events can take time.
Event Streaming
Event Streaming is a data processing paradigm where data is continuously generated, processed, and analyzed in real time as a stream of events. It enables systems to react immediately to incoming data, making it ideal for time-sensitive applications.
- Processes data as a continuous flow of events, enabling real-time collection, processing, and analysis.
- Helps systems respond instantly to changes, making it useful for analytics, decision-making, and system integration.
Advantages
Event streaming provides real-time processing, allowing systems to respond immediately to new information.
- Events are handled as they happen, leading to fast reactions.
- It works well even when there are lots of events coming in quickly.
- Different parts of a system can work alone by read to the events they need.
Disadvantages
While powerful, event streaming can introduce complexity and potential risks if not managed carefully.
- Real-time event streaming can be complicated.
- There is a risk of losing events if the system is not set up correctly.
- Keeping everything in sync can be difficult if not handled properly.
Event Sourcing Vs Event Streaming
Below are the differences between Event Sourcing and Event Streaming:
| Feature | Event Sourcing | Event Streaming | 
|---|---|---|
| Concept | Stores every event to recreate state later | Handles and processes events in real-time | 
| Data Handling | Rebuilds current state from past events | Processes data as it happens | 
| Use Case | Audit logs, rebuilding application state | Real-time data pipelines, live feeds | 
| Data Storage | Stores all past events | Often keeps short history or none | 
| Performance | Slower due to event replay | Faster as events are processed live | 
| Complexity | More complex to manage long-term | Complex to set up and maintain | 
| Recovery | Easy to fix issues by replaying events | Harder to recover from lost events |
