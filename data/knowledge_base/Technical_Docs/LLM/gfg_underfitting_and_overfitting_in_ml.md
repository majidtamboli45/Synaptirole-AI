# Underfitting and Overfitting in ML

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/underfitting-and-overfitting-in-machine-learning/

Machine learning models should learn useful patterns from training data. When a model learns too little or too much, we get underfitting or overfitting.
- Underfitting means that the model is too simple and does not cover all real patterns in the data.
- Overfitting means that the model learns not just the underlying pattern, but also noise or random quirks in the training data. model memorizes training data
- A good model finds the right spot, it is complex enough to capture real patterns, but not so complex that it “memorizes” noise
What is Underfitting?
Underfitting happens when the model fails to learn important patterns. It performs poorly on both training and testing data. Underfitting happens due to:
- Model is too simple
- Very high regularization
- Features are weak or missing
- Not enough training
- High bias
Bias: It is like assuming all birds can only be small and fly, so the model fails to recognize big birds like ostriches or penguins that can't fly and get biased with predictions.
Bias–Variance Inside Underfitting
Underfitting mainly occurs due to high bias:
- High bias means model makes strong assumptions
- Ignores patterns
- Learns an overly simple representation
- Variance is low because the model gives similar outputs even if the data changes
Underfitting = High Bias + Low Variance
What is Overfitting?
Overfitting happens when the model learns too much from the training data, including noise and outliers. It performs very well on training data but poorly on test data. Overfitting happens due to:
- Model too complex
- Too many features
- Very little data
- No regularization
- High variance
Variance: Error that happens when a machine learning model learns too much from the data, including random noise.
Bias–Variance Inside Overfitting
Overfitting is mainly caused by high variance:
- High variance means model reacts too strongly to training data
- Learns noise as patterns
- Low bias because the model is extremely flexible
Overfitting = Low Bias + High Variance
Let's visually understand the concept of underfitting, proper fitting and overfitting.
- Underfitting : Straight line trying to fit a curved dataset but cannot capture the data's patterns, leading to poor performance on both training and test sets.
- Overfitting: A squiggly curve passing through all training points, failing to generalize performing well on training data but poorly on test data.
- Appropriate Fitting: Curve that follows the data trend without overcomplicating to capture the true patterns in the data.
Bias-Variance Tradeoff
The relationship between bias and variance is often referred to as the bias-variance tradeoff, which highlights the need for balance:
- Increasing model complexity reduces bias but increases variance (risk of overfitting).
- Simplifying the model reduces variance but increases bias (risk of underfitting).
The goal is to find an optimal balance where both bias and variance are minimized, resulting in good generalization performance.
Imagine predicting house prices based on size. You plot the data and try to draw a curve that represents the trend. How well this curve fits depends on the complexity of the model.
- Underfitting (High Bias): A model that is too simple (like a straight line for curved data) misses key patterns and performs poorly on both training and testing data.
- Overfitting (High Variance): A model that is too complex (like a high-degree polynomial) learns noise, fits training data too closely, and performs poorly on new data.
- Ideal Fit (Balanced): A moderately complex model captures the main trend without following noise, giving good performance on both training and testing data.
How to Address Overfitting and Underfitting?
Techniques to Reduce Underfitting
- Use a more complex model
- Add new features and perform feature engineering
- Reduce regularization
- Train for more epochs
- Scale features properly
Techniques to Reduce Overfitting
- Collect more training data
- Reduce model complexity
- Use regularization (L1/L2)
- Apply dropout (for neural networks)
- Use early stopping
- Clean noisy data
