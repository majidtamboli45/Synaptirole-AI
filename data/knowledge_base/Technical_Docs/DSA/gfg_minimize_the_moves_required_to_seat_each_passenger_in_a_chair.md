# Minimize the moves required to seat each passenger in a chair

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/minimize-the-number-of-moves-required-to-seat-each-passenger-in-a-chair

Given two arrays chairs[] and passengers[] of equal length, where chairs[i] is the position of the ith chair and passengers[j] is the position of the jth passenger. Perform the following move any number of times:
- Increase or decrease the position of the ith passenger by 1 (i.e., moving the ith passenger from position x to x+1 or x-1)
Return the minimum number of moves required to move each passenger to get a chair such that no two passengers are in the same chair and every passenger gets a chair.
Note: Initially, multiple passengers or chairs may occupy the same position.
Examples:
Input: chairs[] = [3, 1, 5], passengers[] = [2, 7, 4]
Output: 4
Explanation:
The first passenger is moved from position 2 to position 1
The second passenger is moved from position 7 to position 5
The third passenger is moved from position 4 to position 3
Total moves: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4
Input: chairs[] = [2, 2, 6, 6], passengers[] = [1, 3, 2, 6]
Output: 4
Explanation:
The first passenger is moved from position 1 to position 2
The second passenger is moved from position 3 to position 6
The third passenger is not moved
The fourth passenger is not moved
Total moves: 1 + 3 + 0 + 0 = 4
[Approach] Using Sorting - O(n log n) Time and O(1) Space
The main idea is to solve the problem by first sorting both the chairs and passengers arrays. This ensures that each passenger is matched with the closest available chair in a one-to-one manner. After sorting, the number of moves for each passenger is calculated using the absolute difference between their position and the corresponding chair’s position. Summing up these values for all elements gives the minimum total number of moves required.
