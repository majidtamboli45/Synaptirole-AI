# Detect Cycle in Graph using DSU

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/detect-cycle-in-graph-using-dsu

Given an undirected graph, the task is to check if the graph contains a cycle or not, using DSU.
Examples:
Input: The following is the graph
Output: Yes
Explanation: There is a cycle of vertices {0, 1, 2}.
We already have discussed an algorithm to detect cycle in directed graph. Here Union-Find Algorithm can be used to check whether an undirected graph contains cycle or not. The idea is that,
Initially create subsets containing only a single node which are the parent of itself. Now while traversing through the edges, if the two end nodes of the edge belongs to the same set then they form a cycle. Otherwise, perform union to merge the subsets together.
Note: This method assumes that the graph doesn't contain any self-loops.
Illustration:
Follow the below illustration for a better understanding
Let us consider the following graph:
Use an array to keep track of the subsets and which nodes belong to that subset. Let the array be parent[].
Initially, all slots of parent array are initialized to hold the same values as the node.
parent[] = {0, 1, 2}. Also when the value of the node and its parent are same, that is the root of that subset of nodes.
Now process all edges one by one.
Edge 0-1: 
        => Find the subsets in which vertices 0 and 1 are. 
        => 0 and 1 belongs to subset 0 and 1.
        => Since they are in different subsets, take the union of them. 
        => For taking the union, either make node 0 as parent of node 1 or vice-versa. 
        => 1 is made parent of 0 (1 is now representative of subset {0, 1})
        => parent[] = {1, 1, 2}
Edge 1-2: 
        => 1 is in subset 1 and 2 is in subset 2.
        => Since they are in different subsets, take union.
        => Make 2 as parent of 1. (2 is now representative of subset {0, 1, 2})
        => parent[] = {1, 2, 2}
Edge 0-2: 
        => 0 is in subset 2 and 2 is also in subset 2. 
        => Because 1 is parent of 0 and 2 is parent of 1. So 0 also belongs to subset 2
        => Hence, including this edge forms a cycle. 
Therefore, the above graph contains a cycle.
Follow the below steps to implement the idea:
- Initially create a parent[] array to keep track of the subsets.
- Traverse through all the edges:
  - Check to which subset each of the nodes belong to by finding the parent[] array till the node and the parent are the same.
  - If the two nodes belong to the same subset then they belong to a cycle.
  - Otherwise, perform union operation on those two subsets.
- If no cycle is found, return false.
Below is the implementation of the above approach.

Output
Graph contains cycle
The time and space complexity of the given code is as follows:
Time Complexity:
- Creating the graph takes O(V + E) time, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
- Finding the subset of an element takes O(log V) time in the worst case, where V is the number of vertices. The worst case occurs when the tree is skewed, and the depth of the tree is V.
- Union of two subsets takes O(1) time.
- The loop iterating through all edges takes O(E) time.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(E log V).
However, in practice, it can be much faster than O(E log V) because the worst-case scenario of finding the subset of an element does not happen often.
Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of creating the graph is O(E).
- The space complexity of creating the parent array is O(V).
- The space complexity of the algorithm is O(max(V,E)) because at any point in time, there can be at most max(V,E) subsets.
- Therefore, the overall space complexity of the algorithm is O(max(V,E)).
