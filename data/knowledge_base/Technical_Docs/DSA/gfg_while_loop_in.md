# While loop in Programming

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/while-loop-in-programming

A while loop is a control structure that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true.
- The condition is checked before each iteration, and the loop stops once the condition becomes false.
- It is useful when the number of iterations is not known beforehand.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
void printNumbers() {
    int count = 0;
    // while loop runs while the condition is true
    while (count < 5) {
        cout << count << endl;
        count++;
    }
}
int main() {
    // Calling the function
    printNumbers();
    return 0;
}
public class GfG{
    // Function that prints numbers using while loop
    public static void printNumbers() {
        int count = 0;
        // while loop runs while the condition is true
        while (count < 5) {
            System.out.println(count);
            count++;
        }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Calling the function
        printNumbers();
    }
}
def print_numbers():
    # Function that prints numbers using while loop
    count = 0
    # while loop runs while the condition is true
    while count < 5:
        print(count)
        count += 1
# Calling the function
print_numbers()
using System;
public class GfG
{
    public static void PrintNumbers()
    {
        int count = 0;
        // while loop runs while the condition is true
        while (count < 5)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(count);
            count++;
        }
    }
    public static void Main()
    {
        // Calling the function
        PrintNumbers();
    }
}
function printNumbers() {
    // Function that prints numbers using while loop
    let count = 0;
    // while loop runs while the condition is true
    while (count < 5) {
        console.log(count);
        count++;
    }
}
// Calling the function
printNumbers();
Explanation:
 The code initializes count = 0 and runs a while loop while count < 5. In each iteration, the current value of count is printed using cout, and then count is incremented by 1.
Working:
 The loop starts from 0, prints the value, and increases it by 1 in every iteration. When count becomes 5, the condition count < 5 becomes false, so the loop terminates.
Use Cases of While Loop:
- Input Validation: Repeatedly ask for input until the user provides a valid value.
- Processing Data: Traverse arrays, lists, or collections until a condition is met.
- Event Handling: Continuously monitor events like sensor data or network requests.
- Implementing Algorithms: Used in algorithms such as searching, sorting, and mathematical computations.
- State Machines: Execute logic repeatedly until a state change occurs.
- Games and Simulations: Run the main game loop to update state, process input, and render output.
- Batch Processing: Process multiple tasks (files, records, etc.) until all items are handled.
