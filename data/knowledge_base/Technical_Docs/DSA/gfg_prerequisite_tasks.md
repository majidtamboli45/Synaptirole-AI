# Prerequisite Tasks

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/find-whether-it-is-possible-to-finish-all-tasks-or-not-from-given-dependencies

Given n tasks numbered from 0 to n - 1 and a list of p prerequisite pairs pre[][], where each pair [a, b] means that task b must be completed before task a, determine whether it is possible to complete all the tasks.
Return true if all tasks can be finished; otherwise, return false.
Examples:
Input: n = 4, pre[][] = [[1,0],[2,1],[3,2]]
Output: true
Explanation: Task 0 can be completed first. After completing task 0, task 1 can be completed, followed by task 2 and then task 3. Since all prerequisites can be satisfied, it is possible to complete all the tasks.
Input: n = 2, pre[][] = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: Task 1 requires task 0 to be completed first, while task 0 requires task 1 to be completed first. This creates a cycle, so neither task can be completed first. Hence, it is impossible to complete all the tasks.

Using DFS for Cycle Detection - O(n + p) Time and O(n + p) Space
The idea is to treat each task as a node of a directed graph. If [a, b] is a prerequisite pair, we add an edge from b to a because task b must be completed before task a.
Now, all tasks can be completed only if this graph has no cycle. We use DFS to detect a cycle by keeping track of the tasks that are currently being explored.
If during DFS we reach a task that is already in the current DFS path, a cycle exists, so completing all tasks is impossible.
- Build a directed graph where an edge from b to a represents that task b must be completed before task a.
- Maintain a visited array with three states: 0 for unvisited, 1 for currently visiting, and 2 for completely visited.
- Start DFS from every unvisited task.
- Mark the current task as 1 before exploring its neighbors.
- If we reach a neighbor with state 1, a cycle is found, so return false.
- After all neighbors are processed, mark the task as 2. If no cycle is found, return true.

Topological Sorting (Kahn's Algo) - O(n + p) Time and O(n + p) Space
The idea is to use Kahn's algorithm to find a topological ordering of the tasks.
We start with the tasks that have no prerequisites. We can complete these tasks first and then remove their dependency from the remaining tasks.
Whenever a task has no remaining prerequisites, we add it to the queue and process it next.
If we can process all n tasks, all prerequisites can be satisfied. Otherwise, some tasks remain because of a cycle.
- Build a directed graph where an edge from b to a means task b must be completed before a.
- Calculate the indegree of every task, which represents the no. of prerequisites it currently has.
- Add all tasks with indegree 0 to a queue because they can be completed immediately.
- Remove tasks from the queue and decrease the indegree of their dependent tasks.
- Add a dependent task to the queue when its indegree becomes 0.
- Count the number of tasks processed. If all n tasks are processed, return true;
- Otherwise, return false because a cycle exists.
