# Assign Maximum Cookies

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/assign-cookies

Given two arrays, greed[] and cookie[] such that greed[i] denotes the minimum cookie size wanted by ith child and cookie[i] denotes the size of ith cookie, we have to find the maximum number of children that can be satisfied by assigning them cookies, with each child getting at most 1 cookie.
Note: A child will be satisfied if he is assigned a cookie of size at least equal to his greed. In other words, the ith child will be satified with jth cookie only if greed[i] <= cookie[j].
Examples:
Input: greed[] = [1, 10, 3], cookie[] = [1, 2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: We can only assign  cookie to the first child and third child.
Input: greed[] = [10,100], cookie[] = [1, 2]
Output: 0
Explanation: We can not assign cookies to children.
[Approach] Using Sorting and Two Pointer - O(nlogn + mlogm) Time and O(1) Space
The idea is to assign smallest cookie to each child greedily such that the child gets satisfied. So, we can sort both greed[] and cookie[] and start assigning the smallest cookies to the children with smallest greed.
Steps to solve the problem:
- Sort the greed array greed and the cookie  arrays .
- Initialize two pointers: i (index for children),j (index for cookies)
- Initialize count = 0 to track the number of satisfied children.
- Iterate while both pointers are within their array bounds:
- If cookie[j] >= greed[i] , the cookie can satisfy the child: Incrementcount and Move both pointers .
- Else cookie is too small and Move only the cookie pointer/
- Return count as the total number of satisfied children.
