# Chocolate Distribution Problem

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/chocolate-distribution-problem

Given an array arr[] of n integers where arr[i] represents the number of chocolates in ith packet. Each packet can have a variable number of chocolates. There are m students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets such that:
- Each student gets exactly one packet.
- The difference between the maximum and minimum number of chocolates in the packets given to the students is minimized.
Examples:
Input: arr[] = {7, 3, 2, 4, 9, 12, 56}, m = 3 
Output: 2 
Explanation: If we distribute chocolate packets {3, 2, 4}, we will get the minimum difference, that is 2. 
Input: arr[] = {7, 3, 2, 4, 9, 12, 56}, m = 5 
Output: 7
Explanation: If we distribute chocolate packets {3, 2, 4, 9, 7}, we will get the minimum difference, that is 9 - 2 = 7. 
[Naive Approach] By Generating All Subsets
The idea is to generate all subsets of size m of arr[]. For every subset, find the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in it. Finally, return the minimum difference.
[Expected Approach] Using Sliding Window
The idea is to first sort the array, then use sliding window technique to choose consecutive elements to minimize the difference. After sorting the array, the difference between the maximum and minimum values in any window of size m is minimized.
