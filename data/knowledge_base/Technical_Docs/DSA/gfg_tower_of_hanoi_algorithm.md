# Tower of Hanoi Algorithm

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/c-program-for-tower-of-hanoi

The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle involving three rods (A, B, and C) and n disks of different sizes. Initially, all disks are stacked on rod A in decreasing order of diameter - the largest disk at the bottom and the smallest at the top.
Goal is to move the entire stack to another rod (rod C) while following these rules:
- Move only one disk at a time.
- At each step, you can take the top disk from any rod and place it on another rod.
- A disk can only be moved if it is the topmost disk of a rod.
- No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
Examples:
Input:  n = 3
Output: 
Disk 1 moved from A to C
Disk 2 moved from A to B
Disk 1 moved from C to B
Disk 3 moved from A to C
Disk 1 moved from B to A
Disk 2 moved from B to C
Disk 1 moved from A to C
Input: n = 4
Output:
 Disk 1 moved from A to B
 Disk 2 moved from A to C
 Disk 1 moved from B to C
 Disk 3 moved from A to B
 Disk 1 moved from C to A
 Disk 2 moved from C to B
 Disk 1 moved from A to B
 Disk 4 moved from A to C
 Disk 1 moved from B to C
 Disk 2 moved from B to A
 Disk 1 moved from C to A
 Disk 3 moved from B to C
 Disk 1 moved from A to B
 Disk 2 moved from A to C
 Disk 1 moved from B to C

[Approach] Tower of Hanoi using Recursion
The idea is to use the helper node to reach the destination using recursion. Below is the pattern for this problem:
- Shift 'n-1' disks from 'A' to 'B', using C.
- Shift last disk from 'A' to 'C'.
- Shift 'n-1' disks from 'B' to 'C', using A.
Follow the steps below to solve the problem:
- Create a function towerOfHanoi where pass the n (current number of disk), fromRod, toRod, auxRod.
- Make a function call for n - 1 th disk.
- Then print the current the disk along with from_rod and to_rod
- Again make a function call for n - 1 th disk.

using namespace std;

        return;
    }
    towerOfHanoi(n - 1, fromRod, auxRod, toRod);
    cout << "Disk " << n << " moved from " << fromRod
         << " to " << toRod << endl;
    towerOfHanoi(n - 1, auxRod, toRod, fromRod);

Output
Disk 1 moved from A to C
Disk 2 moved from A to B
Disk 1 moved from C to B
Disk 3 moved from A to C
Disk 1 moved from B to A
Disk 2 moved from B to C
Disk 1 moved from A to C
Time complexity: O(2n), There are two possibilities for every disk. Therefore, 2 * 2 * 2 * . . . * 2(n times) is 2n
Auxiliary Space: O(n), Function call stack space
