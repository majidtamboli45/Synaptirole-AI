Big O notation is used to describe the time or space complexity of algorithms. Big-O is a way to express an upper bound of an algorithm’s time or space complexity.
- Describes the asymptotic behavior (order of growth of time or space in terms of input size) of a function, not its exact value.
- Can be used to compare the efficiency of different algorithms or data structures.
- It provides an upper limit on the time taken by an algorithm in terms of the size of the input. We mainly consider the worst case scenario of the algorithm to find its time complexity in terms of Big O
Big O Definition
Given two functions f(n) and g(n), we say that f(n) is O(g(n)) if there exist constants c > 0 and n0 >= 0 such that f(n) <= c*g(n) for all n >= n0.
In simpler terms, f(n) is O(g(n)) if f(n) grows no faster than c*g(n) for all n >= n0 where c and n0 are constants.
A Quick Way to find Big O of an Expression
- Ignore the lower order terms and consider only highest order term.
- Ignore the constant associated with the highest order term.
Example 1:  f(n) = 3n2 + 2n + 1000Logn +  5000
After ignoring lower order terms, we get the highest order term as 3n2
After ignoring the constant 3, we get n2
Therefore the Big O value of this expression is O(n2)
Example 2 :  f(n) = 3n3 + 2n2 + 5n + 1
Dominant Term: 3n3
Order of Growth: Cubic (n3)
Big O Notation: O(n3)
Properties of Big O Notation
Below are some important Properties of Big O Notation:
1. Reflexivity
For any function f(n), f(n) = O(f(n)).
Example:
f(n) = n2, then f(n) = O(n2).
2. Transitivity
If f(n) = O(g(n)) and g(n) = O(h(n)), then f(n) = O(h(n)).
Example:
If f(n) = n^2, g(n) = n^3, and h(n) = n^4, then f(n) = O(g(n)) and g(n) = O(h(n)). 
Therefore, by transitivity, f(n) = O(h(n)).
3. Constant Factor
For any constant c > 0 and functions f(n) and g(n), if f(n) = O(g(n)), then cf(n) = O(g(n)).
Example:
f(n) = n, g(n) = n2. Then f(n) = O(g(n)). Therefore, 2f(n) = O(g(n)).
4. Sum Rule
If f(n) = O(g(n)) and h(n) = O(k(n)), then f(n) + h(n) = O(max( g(n), k(n) ) When combining complexities, only the largest term dominates.
Example:
f(n) = n2, h(n) = n3. Then , f(n) + h(n) = O(max(n2 + n3) = O ( n3)
5. Product Rule
If f(n) = O(g(n)) and h(n) = O(k(n)), then f(n) * h(n) = O(g(n) * k(n)).
Example:
f(n) = n, g(n) = n2, h(n) = n3, k(n) = n4. Then f(n) = O(g(n)) and h(n) = O(k(n)). Therefore, f(n) * h(n) = O(g(n) * k(n)) = O(n6).
6. Composition Rule
If f(n) = O(g(n)), then f(h(n)) = O(g(h(n))).
Example:
If 
f(n) = n^2 ,g(n) = n^3 andh(n) = log n , then by composition rule f(h(n))=O(g(h(n))). Therefore,(log n)^2=O((log n)^3) .
Common Big-O Notations
Big-O notation is a way to measure the time and space complexity of an algorithm. It describes the upper bound of the complexity in the worst-case scenario. Let’s look into the different types of time complexities:
1. Linear Time Complexity: Big O(n) Complexity
Linear time complexity means that the running time of an algorithm grows linearly with the size of the input.
For example, consider an algorithm that traverses through an array to find a specific element:
bool findElement(int arr[], int n, int key)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == key) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
2. Logarithmic Time Complexity: Big O(log n) Complexity
Logarithmic time complexity means that the running time of an algorithm is proportional to the logarithm of the input size.
For example, a binary search algorithm has a logarithmic time complexity:
int binarySearch(int arr[], int l, int r, int x)
{
    if (r >= l) {
        int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == x)
            return mid;
        if (arr[mid] > x)
            return binarySearch(arr, l, mid - 1, x);
        return binarySearch(arr, mid + 1, r, x);
    }
    return -1;
}
3. Quadratic Time Complexity: Big O(n2) Complexity
Quadratic time complexity means that the running time of an algorithm is proportional to the square of the input size.
For example, a simple bubble sort algorithm has a quadratic time complexity:
void bubbleSort(int arr[], int n)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                swap(&arr[j], &arr[j + 1]);
            }
        }
    }
}
4. Cubic Time Complexity: Big O(n3) Complexity
Cubic time complexity means that the running time of an algorithm is proportional to the cube of the input size.
For example, a naive matrix multiplication algorithm has a cubic time complexity:
void multiply(int mat1[][N], int mat2[][N], int res[][N])
{
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
            res[i][j] = 0;
            for (int k = 0; k < N; k++)
                res[i][j] += mat1[i][k] * mat2[k][j];
        }
    }
}
5. Polynomial Time Complexity: Big O(nk) Complexity
Polynomial time complexity refers to the time complexity of an algorithm that can be expressed as a polynomial function of the input size n. In Big O notation, an algorithm is said to have polynomial time complexity if its time complexity is O(nk), where k is a constant and represents the degree of the polynomial.
Algorithms with polynomial time complexity are generally considered efficient, as the running time grows at a reasonable rate as the input size increases. Common examples of algorithms with polynomial time complexity include linear time complexity O(n), quadratic time complexity O(n2), and cubic time complexity O(n3).
6. Exponential Time Complexity: Big O(2n) Complexity
Exponential time complexity means that the running time of an algorithm doubles with each addition to the input data set.
For example, the problem of generating all subsets of a set is of exponential time complexity:
void generateSubsets(int arr[], int n)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < (1 << n); i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (i & (1 << j)) {
                cout << arr[j] << " ";
            }
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
}
7. Factorial Time Complexity: Big O(n!) Complexity
Factorial time complexity means that the running time of an algorithm grows factorially with the size of the input. This is often seen in algorithms that generate all permutations of a set of data.
Here’s an example of a factorial time complexity algorithm, which generates all permutations of an array:
void permute(int* a, int l, int r)
{
    if (l == r) {
        for (int i = 0; i <= r; i++) {
            cout << a[i] << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
    else {
        for (int i = l; i <= r; i++) {
            swap(a[l], a[i]);
            permute(a, l + 1, r);
            swap(a[l], a[i]); // backtrack
        }
    }
}
If we plot the most common Big O notation examples, we would have graph like this:
