Bitwise operators are special operators in programming that work directly on binary bits (0 and 1). Since computers store all data in binary form, bitwise operations help us manipulate data at the lowest level using operations like AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and bit shifting.
- They are commonly used in optimization, performance-critical code, masking, toggling bits, and low-level programming.
- They are used to perform fast calculations and binary manipulation.
- They help in setting, clearing, checking, and toggling bits.
- Bitwise operations are often faster for low-level and bit-manipulation tasks.
- Bitwise operations enable packing multiple flags into a single variable, reducing memory usage.
Bitwise Operators / Basics of Bit manipulation
Bit manipulation works on binary bits (0 and 1) using bitwise operators, making it fast and efficient. These operations are executed by the CPU’s Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and are commonly used for optimization, efficient flag handling, and performance-critical tasks.
The main bitwise operators are:
- AND (&)
- OR (|)
- XOR (^)
- NOT (~)
- Left Shift (<<)
- Right Shift (>>)
Bitwise AND Operator (&)
The bitwise AND operator is denoted using a single ampersand symbol, i.e. &. The & operator takes two equal-length bit patterns as parameters. The two-bit integers are compared. If the bits in the compared positions of the bit patterns are 1, then the resulting bit is 1. If not, it is 0.
Example:
Take two bit values X and Y, where X = 7= (111)2 and Y = 4 = (100)2 . Take Bitwise and of both X & y
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int a = 7, b = 4;
    int result = a & b;
    cout << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
import java.io.*;
class GFG {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        int a = 7, b = 4;
          int result = a & b;
          System.out.println(result);
    }
}
a = 7
b = 4
result = a & b
print(result)
using System;
public class GFG{
    static public void Main (){
      int a = 7, b = 4;
      int result = a & b;
      Console.WriteLine(result);
    }
}
let a = 7, b = 4;
let result = a & b;
console.log(result);
Output
4
Bitwise OR Operator (|)
The | Operator takes two equivalent length bit designs as boundaries; if the two bits in the looked-at position are 0, the next bit is zero. If not, it is 1.
Example:
Take two bit values X and Y, where X = 7= (111)2 and Y = 4 = (100)2 . Take Bitwise OR of both X, y
Explanation: On the basis of truth table of bitwise OR operator we can conclude that the result of
1 | 1  = 1
1 | 0 = 1
0 | 1 = 1
0 | 0 = 0
We used the similar concept of bitwise operator that are show in the image.
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int a = 12, b = 25;
    int result = a | b;
    cout << result;
    return 0;
}
import java.io.*;
class GFG {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int a = 12, b = 25;
        int result = a | b;
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
a = 12
b = 25
result = a | b
print(result)
using System;
public class GFG{
    static public void Main (){
        int a = 12, b = 25;
        int result = a | b;
        Console.WriteLine(result);
    }
}
    let a = 12, b = 25;
    let result = a | b;
    console.log(result);
Output
29
Bitwise XOR Operator (^)
The ^ operator (also known as the XOR operator) stands for Exclusive Or. Here, if bits in the compared position do not match their resulting bit is 1. i.e, The result of the bitwise XOR operator is 1 if the corresponding bits of two operands are opposite, otherwise 0.
Example:
Take two bit values X and Y, where X = 7= (111)2 and Y = 4 = (100)2 . Take Bitwise and of both X & y
Explanation: On the basis of truth table of bitwise XOR operator we can conclude that the result of
1 ^ 1  = 0
1 ^ 0 = 1
0 ^ 1 = 1
0 ^ 0 = 0
We used the similar concept of bitwise operator that are show in the image.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int a = 12, b = 25;
    cout << (a ^ b);
    return 0;
}
import java.io.*;
class GFG {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int a = 12, b = 25;
        int result = a ^ b;
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
a = 12
b = 25
result = a ^ b
print(result)
// C# Code
using System;
public class GFG {
    static public void Main()
    {
        // Code
        int a = 12, b = 25;
        int result = a ^ b;
        Console.WriteLine(result);
    }
}
let a = 12;
let b = 25;
console.log((a ^ b));
Output

Bitwise NOT Operator (~)
All the above three bitwise operators are binary operators (i.e, requiring two operands in order to operate). Unlike other bitwise operators, this one requires only one operand to operate.
- The bitwise Not Operator takes a single value and returns its one’s complement.
- The one’s complement of a binary number is obtained by toggling all bits in it, i.e, transforming the 0 bit to 1 and the 1 bit to 0.
Example:
Take a 4-bit value X, where X = 9 = (1001)₂. Take the Bitwise NOT of X.
Explanation: The bitwise NOT operator (~) flips every individual bit in the binary representation of a number. Based on the truth table, every 1 becomes a 0, and every 0 becomes a 1.
The resulting binary string is 0110₂, which is equal to the decimal number 6.
Note: The output of ~ changes depending on how many bits your system uses. In a 4-bit system, ~9 (1001) becomes 0110 (6). But in an 8-bit system, 9 is stored with leading zeros as 0000 1001. Flipping it yields 1111 0110, giving a completely different decimal result.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int a = 9;
    
    cout << "Original value of a: " << a << endl;
    cout << "Inverting using NOT operator (~a): " << (~a) << endl;
        
    // Why is the output -10?
    // 1. A 32-bit int for 9 is padded with zeros: 0000...00001001
    // 2. The '~' operator flips EVERY bit:        1111...11110110
    // 3. Because the first bit is 1, the computer reads it as a negative number.
    // 4. In Two's Complement math, this evaluates to -10. 
    // Shortcut formula: ~x = -(x + 1)
    return 0;
}
public class GFG {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        int a = 9;
        
        System.out.print("Value of a without using NOT operator: " + a);

Output
Value of a without using NOT operator: 0
Inverting using NOT operator (with sign bit): -1
Left-Shift (<<)
The left shift operator is denoted by the double left arrow key (<<). The general syntax for left shift is shift-expression << k. The left-shift operator causes the bits in shift expression to be shifted to the left by the number of positions specified by k. The bit positions that the shift operation has vacated are zero-filled.
Note: Every time we shift a number towards the left by 1 bit it multiply that number by 2.
Example:
Input: Left shift of 5 by 1.
Binary representation of 5 = 00101 and Left shift of 001012 by 1 (i.e, 00101 << 1)
 
Output: 10
Explanation: All bit of 5 will be shifted by 1 to left side and this result in 010102, Which is equivalent to 10
Input: Left shift of 5 by 2.
Binary representation of 5 = 00101 and Left shift of 001012 by 1 (i.e, 00101 << 2)
Output: 20
Explanation: All bit of 5 will be shifted by 1 to left side and this result in 101002, Which is equivalent to 20
Input: Left shift of 5 by 3.
Binary representation of 5 = 00101 and Left shift of 001012 by 1 (i.e, 00101 << 3)
Output: 40
Explanation: All bit of 5 will be shifted by 1 to left side and this result in 010002, Which is equivalent to 40

Right-Shift (>>)
The right shift operator is denoted by the double right arrow key (>>). The general syntax for the right shift is "shift-expression >> k". The right-shift operator causes the bits in shift expression to be shifted to the right by the number of positions specified by k. For unsigned numbers, the bit positions that the shift operation has vacated are zero-filled. For signed numbers, the sign bit is used to fill the vacated bit positions. In other words, if the number is positive, 0 is used, and if the number is negative, 1 is used.
Note: Every time we shift a number towards the right by 1 bit it divides that number by 2.
Example:
Input: Right shift of 5 by 1.
Binary representation of 5 = 00101 and Right shift of 00101 by 1 (i.e, 00101 >> 1)
Output: 2
Explanation: All bit of 5 will be shifted by 1 to Rightside and this result in 00010Which is equivalent to 2
Input: Right shift of 5 by 2.
Binary representation of 5 = 00101 and Right shift of 00101 by 2 (i.e, 00101 >> 2)
Output: 1
Explanation: All bit of 5 will be shifted by 2 to Right side and this result in 00001, Which is equivalent to 1
Input: Right shift of 5 by 3.
Binary representation of 5 = 00101 and Right shift of 00101 by 3 (i.e, 00101 >> 3)
Output: 0
Explanation: All bit of 5 will be shifted by 3 to Right side and this result in 00000, Which is equivalent to 0

Application of Bit Operators
- Bit operations are used for the optimization of embedded systems.
- The Exclusive-or operator can be used to confirm the integrity of a file, making sure it has not been corrupted, especially after it has been in transit.
- Bitwise operations are used in Data encryption and compression.
- Bits are used in the area of networking, framing the packets of numerous bits which are sent to another system generally through any type of serial interface.
- Digital Image Processors use bitwise operations to enhance image pixels and to extract different sections of a microscopic image.
Practice Problems on Bitwise Algorithm
Solve these questions to improve your understanding of bitwise operators and bit manipulation techniques.
Note: All the above Bitwise Practice Problems are optimized and run in O(1) Time Complexity with O(1) Auxiliary Space.
1. Set a bit in the number
If we want to set a bit at nth position in the number 'num', it can be done using the 'OR' operator( | ).
- First, we left shift 1 to n position via (1<<n).
- Then, use the "OR" operator to set the bit at that position. "OR" operator is used because it will set the bit even if the bit is unset previously in the binary representation of the number 'num'.
Note: If the bit would be already set then it would remain unchanged.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
// num is the number and pos is the position
// at which we want to set the bit.
void Set(int& num, int pos)
{
    // First step is shift '1', second
    // step is bitwise OR
    num |= (1 << pos);
}
int main()
{
    int num = 4, pos = 1;
    Set(num, pos);
    cout << num << endl;
    return 0;
}
import java.io.*;
class GFG {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int num = 4, pos = 1;
        num = set(num, pos);
        System.out.println(num);
    }
    public static int set(int num, int pos)
    {
        // First step is shift '1', second
        // step is bitwise OR
        num |= (1 << pos);
        return num;
    }
}
# num = number, pos = position at which we want to set the bit
def set(num, pos):
    # First step = Shift '1'
    # Second step = Bitwise OR
    num |= (1 << pos)
    print(num)
num, pos = 4, 1
set(num, pos)
using System;
public class GFG {
    static public void Main()
    {
        int num = 4, pos = 1;
        set(num, pos);
    }
    // num = number, pos = position at which we want to set
    // the bit
    static public void set(int num, int pos)
    {
        // First Step: Shift '1'
        // Second Step: Bitwise OR
        num |= (1 << pos);
        Console.WriteLine(num);
    }
}
// num is the number and pos is the position 
// at which we want to set the bit.
function set(num,pos)
{
     // First step is shift '1', second
     // step is bitwise OR
     num |= (1 << pos);
     console.log(parseInt(num));
}
let num = 4;
let pos = 1;
set(num, pos);
Output
6
2. unset/clear a bit at n'th position in the number
Suppose we want to unset a bit at nth position in number 'num' then we have to do this with the help of "AND" (&) operator.
- First, we left shift '1' to n position via (1<<n) then we use bitwise NOT operator '~' to unset this shifted '1'.
- Now after clearing this left shifted '1' i.e making it to '0' we will 'AND'(&) with the number 'num' that will unset bit at nth position.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
// First step is to get a number that  has all 1's except
// the given position.
void unset(int& num, int pos)
{
    // Second step is to bitwise and this  number with given
    // number
    num &= (~(1 << pos));
}
int main()
{
    int num = 7;
    int pos = 1;
    unset(num, pos);
    cout << num << endl;
    return 0;
}
/*package whatever //do not write package name here */
import java.io.*;
class GFG {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int num = 7, pos = 1;
        num = unset(num, pos);
        System.out.println(num);
    }
    public static int unset(int num, int pos)
    {
        // Second step is to bitwise and this  number with
        // given number
        num = num & (~(1 << pos));
        return num;
    }
}
# First Step: Getting which have all '1's except the
# given position
def unset(num, pos):
    # Second Step: Bitwise AND this number with the given number
    num &= (~(1 << pos))
    print(num)
num, pos = 7, 1
unset(num, pos)
using System;
public class GFG {
    static public void Main()
    {
        // First Step: Getting a number which have all '1's
        // except the given position
        int num = 7, pos = 1;
        unset(num, pos);
    }
    static public void unset(int num, int pos)
    {
        // Second Step: Bitwise AND this number with the
        // given number
        num &= (~(1 << pos));
        Console.WriteLine(num);
    }
}
// First step is to get a number that  has all 1's except
// the given position.
function unset(num, pos)
{
    // Second step is to bitwise and this  number with given
    // number
    return num &= (~(1 << pos));
}
let num = 7;
let pos = 1;
console.log(unset(num, pos));
Output

3. Toggling a bit at nth position
Toggling means to turn bit 'on'(1) if it was 'off'(0) and to turn 'off'(0) if it was 'on'(1) previously. We will be using the 'XOR' operator here which is this '^'. The reason behind the 'XOR' operator is because of its properties.
Properties of 'XOR' operator.
- 1^1 = 0
- 0^0 = 0
- 1^0 = 1
- 0^1 = 1
If two bits are different then the 'XOR' operator returns a set bit(1) else it returns an unset bit(0).
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
// First step is to shift 1,Second step is to XOR with given
// number
void toggle(int& num, int pos) { num ^= (1 << pos); }
int main()
{
    int num = 4;
    int pos = 1;
    toggle(num, pos);
    cout << num << endl;
    return 0;
}
import java.io.*;
class GFG {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int num = 4, pos = 1;
        num = toggle(num, pos);
        System.out.println(num);
    }
    public static int toggle(int num, int pos)
    {
        // First step is to shift 1,Second step is to XOR
        // with given number
        num ^= (1 << pos);
        return num;
    }
}
def toggle(num, pos):
    # First Step: Shifts '1'

    num ^= (1 << pos)
    print(num)

4. Checking if the bit at nth position is Set or Unset
We used the left shift (<<) operation on 1 to shift the bits to nth position and then use the & operation with number given number, and check if it is not-equals to 0.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
bool at_position(int num, int pos)
{
    bool bit = num & (1 << pos);
    return bit;
}
int main()
{
    int num = 5;
    int pos = 2;
    bool bit = at_position(num, pos);
    cout << bit << endl;
    return 0;
}
import java.io.*;
class GFG {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int num = 5;
        int pos = 0;
        int bit = at_position(num, pos);
        System.out.println(bit);
    }
    public static int at_position(int num, int pos)
    {
        int bit = num & (1 << pos);
        return bit;
    }
}
# code
def at_position(num, pos):
    bit = num & (1 << pos)
    return bit
num = 5
pos = 0
bit = at_position(num, pos)
print(bit)
using System;
public class GFG {
  public static bool at_position(int num, int pos)
  {
    int bit = num & (1 << pos);
    if (bit == 0)
      return false;
    return true;
  }
  static public void Main()
  {
    int num = 5;
    int pos = 2;
    bool bit = at_position(num, pos);
    Console.WriteLine(bit);
  }
}
function at_position(num,pos)
{
 return num & (1<<pos);
}
let num = 5;
let pos = 0;
console.log(at_position(num, pos));
Output

5. Multiply a number by 2 using the left shift operator
You can multiply a number by 2 by using the left shift operator (<< 1), which shifts all bits one position to the left.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int num = 12;
    int ans = num << 1;
    cout << ans << endl;
    return 0;
}
import java.io.*;
class GFG {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int num = 12;
        int ans = num << 1;
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
# Python program for the above approach
num = 12
ans = num << 1
print(ans)
using System;
public class GFG {
    static public void Main()
    {
        int num = 12;
        Console.WriteLine(num << 1);
    }
}
// Javascript program for the above approach
var num = 12;
var ans = num<<1;
console.log(ans);
Output
24
6. Divide a number 2 using the right shift operator
You can divide a number by 2 using the right shift operator (>> 1), which shifts all bits one position to the right.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int num = 12;
    int ans = num >> 1;
    cout << ans << endl;
    return 0;
}
import java.io.*;
class GFG {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int num = 12;
        int ans = num >> 1;
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
# Python program for the above approach
num = 12
ans = num >> 1
print(ans)
using System;
public class GFG {
    static public void Main()
    {
        int num = 12;
        Console.WriteLine(num >> 1);
    }
}
// Javascript program for the above approach
var num = 12;
var ans = num>>1;
console.log(ans);
Output

7. Compute XOR from 1 to n (direct method)
The problem Compute XOR from 1 to n can be solved based on the following observations: n%4==0->n, 1->1, 2->n+1, 3-0.
Say x = n % 4. The XOR value depends on the value if x.
If, x = 0, then the answer is n.
   x = 1, then answer is 1.
   x = 2, then answer is n+1.
   x = 3, then answer is 0.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
// Direct XOR of all numbers from 1 to n
int computeXOR(int n)
{
    if (n % 4 == 0) return n;
    if (n % 4 == 1) return 1;
    if (n % 4 == 2) return n + 1;
    return 0;
}
int main()
{
    int n = 5;
    cout << computeXOR(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
import java.io.*;
class GFG {
    // Direct XOR of all numbers from 1 to n
    public static int computeXOR(int n) {
        if (n % 4 == 0) return n;
        if (n % 4 == 1) return 1;
        if (n % 4 == 2) return n + 1;
        return 0;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 5;
        System.out.println(computeXOR(n)); 
    }
}
def setBit(num, pos):
    num |= (1 << pos)
    return num
num, pos = 0, 0
print(setBit(num, pos))
using System;
public class GFG
{
    // Direct XOR of all numbers from 1 to n
    public static int computeXOR(int n)
    {
        if (n % 4 == 0) return n;
        if (n % 4 == 1) return 1;
        if (n % 4 == 2) return n + 1;
        return 0;
    }
    public static void Main()
    {
        int n = 5;
        Console.WriteLine(computeXOR(n));
    }
}
// Direct XOR of all numbers from 1 to n
function computeXOR(n) {
  if (n % 4 === 0) return n;
  if (n % 4 === 1) return 1;
  if (n % 4 === 2) return n + 1;
  return 0;
}
console.log(computeXOR(5));
8. How to know if a number is a power of 2?
This can be solved based on the following fact:
If a number N is a power of 2, then the bitwise AND of N and N-1 will be 0. But this will not work if N is 0. So just check these two conditions, if any of these two conditions is true.
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
// Function to check if x is power of 2
bool isPowerOfTwo(int x)
{
    // First x in the below expression is
    // for the case when x is 0
    return x && (!(x & (x - 1)));
}
int main ()
{
    cout<<isPowerOfTwo(2);
    return 0;
}
public class Main {
    // Function to check if x is power of 2
    public static boolean isPowerOfTwo(int x) {
        return x != 0 && ((x & (x - 1)) == 0);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(isPowerOfTwo(2));
    }
}
# Function to check if x is power of 2
def isPowerOfTwo(x):
    return x and (not (x & (x - 1)))
print(isPowerOfTwo(2))
using System;
public class GFG
{
    // Function to check if x is power of 2
    static public bool isPowerOfTwo(int x)
    {
        return (x != 0) && ((x & (x - 1)) == 0);
    }
    static public void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(isPowerOfTwo(2));
    }
}
// Function to check if x is power of 2
function isPowerOfTwo(x)
{
    // First x in the below expression is
    // for the case when x is 0
    return x && (!(x & (x - 1)));
}
console.log(isPowerOfTwo(2));
9. Count Set bits in an integer
Counting set bits means, counting total number of 1’s in the binary representation of an integer. For this problem we go through all the bits of given number and check whether it is set or not by performing AND operation (with 1).
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
// Function to calculate the number of set bits
int countBits(int n)
{
    int count = 0;
    while (n)
    {
        count += (n & 1);
        n >>= 1;
    }
    return count;
}
int main()
{
    int n = 5;
    cout << countBits(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
public class Main {
    // Function to calculate the number of set bits
    public static int countBits(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            count += (n & 1);
            n >>= 1;
        }
        return count;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(countBits(5)); // Output: 2
    }
}
def countBits(n):
    count = 0
    while n:
        count += (n & 1)
        n >>= 1
    return count
print(countBits(5))
using System;
public class GFG
{
    // Function to calculate the number of set bits
    public static int countBits(int n)
    {
        int count = 0;
        while (n > 0)
        {
            count += (n & 1);
            n >>= 1;
        }
        return count;
    }
    static public void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(countBits(5)); // Output: 2
    }
}
// Function to calculate the number of set bits
function countBits(n) {
  let count = 0;
  while (n > 0) {
    count += (n & 1);
    n >>= 1;
  }
  return count;
}
console.log(countBits(5));
10. Position of rightmost set bit
The idea is to unset the rightmost bit of number n and XOR the result with n. Then the rightmost set bit in n will be the position of the only set bit in the result. Note that if n is odd, we can directly return 1 as the first bit is always set for odd numbers.
Example: The number 20 in binary is 00010100, and the position of the rightmost set bit is 3.
00010100    &               (n = 20)
00010011                     (n-1 = 19)
-------------------
00010000    ^                (XOR result number with n)
00010100
-------------------
00000100 ------->  rightmost set bit will tell us the position
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
// Returns the position of the rightmost set bit of n (1-based)
int positionOfRightmostSetBit(int n)

    n = n ^ (n & (n - 1));
