# Terraform Syntax With Examples

Terraform Uses HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) which help engineers in designing repeatable and production-ready systems with ease.
- Terraform Eliminates manual provisioning through automated infrastructure management.
- Uses HCL, a human-readable language to define the desired infrastructure state.
- Supports multi-cloud and on-premises deployments with consistent workflows.
- Enables scalable, reliable, and version-controlled infrastructure.
Language Used In Terraform
HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) is the DSL (Domain Specific Language) that Terraform uses to create infrastructure resources. HCL is a human-readable language, designed to be easy to understand while still being expressive.
- It is Declarative rather than procedural.
- Supports complex data structures.
- Compatible with JSON.
Terraform Syntax With Examples
Terraform syntax is built around blocks, arguments, and expressions that define infrastructure resources and their configurations. Terraform follows a declarative model, meaning you specify what your infrastructure should look like, and Terraform determines how to achieve that state by building a dependency graph and executing changes in the correct order.
1. Terraform Block Syntax
The terraform block defines project-level settings such as required providers and Terraform version constraints.
terraform {
   required_version = ">= 1.5.0"
   required_providers {
aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
}
}
}
2. Terraform Resource Block Syntax
The fundamental building block in Terraform is a resource block. It refers to a single piece of infrastructure that you want to control. Here is an illustration of how to create an AWS EC2 instance:
resource "aws_instance" "gfg-ec2" {
ami = "ami-0c94855ba95c286c99"
instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
In the above code we have used the resource type as "aws_instance" and given it the name "gfg-ec2" and specified the AMI ID and the type of instance we need for it.
3. Terraform Variable Declaration Syntax
We are able to parameterize our configurations in Terraform with the help of variables, which can make our code much more reusable and adaptable. For example:
variable "region" {
description = "AWS region where the resources will be deployed."
type = string
default = "us-east-1"
}
In the above example, we have created a variable region with a default value of "us-east-1".
4. Terraform Output Values Syntax
You can extract data from your infrastructure and send it to other configurations or use it as a reference by using Terraform's output values. For example:
output "gfg_instance_ip" {
value = aws_instance.example.public_ip
description = "Public IP of the EC2 instance recently deployed."
}
In the above code, we are trying to get the public ip of our EC2 instance by creating an output named "instance_ip".
5. Terraform Modules Syntax
We can encapsulate and reuse setups using Terraform modules. They support the creation of reusable components from our infrastructure code. Here is a usage example for a module
module "vpc" {
source = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
version = "2.0.1"
name = "my-gfg-vpc"
cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"
}
In the above code, we are creating a VPC and for that, we are using the "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws" module from the Terraform Registry. Then we are passing the required parameters inside the block. These examples show the basic syntax and applications of Terraform and HCL. Terraform, however, offers a large selection of resource types, providers, and extra tools like data sources, conditional expressions, and loops.
