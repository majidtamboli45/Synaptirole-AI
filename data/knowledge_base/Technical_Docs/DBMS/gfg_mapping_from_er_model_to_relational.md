# Mapping from ER Model to Relational Model

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dbms/mapping-from-er-model-to-relational-model/

Converting an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram to a Relational Model is an important step in database design. The ER model represents the conceptual structure of a database, and the Relational Model is a physical representation that can be directly implemented using a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) like Oracle or MySQL.
Different Cases
Case 1: Binary Relationship with 1:1 cardinality with total participation of an entity
Note: A person has 0 or 1 passport number and Passport is always owned by 1 person. So it is 1:1 cardinality with full participation constraint from Passport.
- First Convert each entity and relationship to tables.
- Person table corresponds to Person Entity with key as Per-Id. Similarly Passport table corresponds to Passport Entity with key as Pass-No.
- Has Table represents relationship between Person and Passport (Which person has which passport). So it will take attribute Per-Id from Person and Pass-No from Passport.
Table 1
| Person |  |  | Has |  |  | Passport |  | 
| Per-Id | Other Person Attribute |  | Per-Id | Pass-No |  | Pass-No | Other PassportAttribute | 
| PR1 | - |  | PR1 | PS1 |  | PS1 | - | 
| PR2 | - |  | PR2 | PS2 |  | PS2 | - | 
| PR3 | - |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
- As we can see from Table 1, each Per-Id and Pass-No has only one entry in Has Table.
- So we can merge all three tables into 1 with attributes shown in Table 2. Each Per-Id will be unique and not null.
Table 2
| Per-Id | Other Person Attribute | Pass-No | Other PassportAttribute | 
Note: So it will be the key. Pass-No can’t be key because for some person, it can be NULL.
Case 2: Binary Relationship with 1:1 cardinality and partial participation of both entities
- A male marries 0 or 1 female and vice versa as well. So it is 1:1 cardinality with partial participation constraint from both.
- First Convert each entity and relationship to tables.
- Male table corresponds to Male Entity with key as M-Id. Similarly Female table corresponds to Female Entity with key as F-Id.
- Marry Table represents relationship between Male and Female (Which Male marries which female). So it will take attribute M-Id from Male and F-Id from Female.
Table 3
| Male |  |  | Marry |  |  | Female |  | 
| M-Id | Other Male Attribute |  | M-Id | F-Id |  | F-Id | Other FemaleAttribute | 
| M1 | - |  | M1 | F2 |  | F1 | - | 
| M2 | - |  | M2 | F1 |  | F2 | - | 
| M3 | - |  |  |  |  | F3 | - | 
- As we can see from Table 3, some males and some females do not marry.
- If we merge 3 tables into 1, for some M-Id, F-Id will be NULL. So there is no attribute which is always not NULL.
- So we can’t merge all three tables into 1. We can convert into 2 tables. In table 4, M-Id who are married will have F-Id associated. For others, it will be NULL.
- Table 5 will have information of all females. Primary Keys have been underlined.
Table 4
| M-Id | Other Male Attribute | F-Id | 
Table 5
| F-Id | Other FemaleAttribute | 
Note: Binary relationship with 1:1 cardinality will have 2 table if partial participation of both entities in the relationship. If atleast 1 entity has total participation, number of tables required will be 1.
Case 3: Binary Relationship with n: 1 cardinality
- In this scenario, every student can enroll only in one elective course but for an elective course there can be more than one student.
- First Convert each entity and relationship to tables. Student table corresponds to Student Entity with key as S-Id.
- Similarly Elective_Course table corresponds to Elective_Course Entity with key as E-Id.
- Enrolls Table represents relationship between Student and Elective_Course (Which student enrolls in which course). So it will take attribute S-Id from Student and E-Id from Elective_Course.
Table 6
| Student |  |  | Enrolls |  |  | Elective_Course |  | 
| S-Id | Other Student Attribute |  | S-Id | E-Id |  | E-Id | Other Elective CourseAttribute | 
| S1 | - |  | S1 | E1 |  | E1 | - | 
| S2 | - |  | S2 | E2 |  | E2 | - | 
| S3 | - |  | S3 | E1 |  | E3 | - | 
| S4 | - |  | S4 | E1 |  |  |  | 
- As we can see from Table 6, S-Id is not repeating in Enrolls Table. So it can be considered as a key of Enrolls table.
- Both Student and Enrolls Table’s key is same. We can merge it as a single table.
Table 7
| S-Id | Other Student Attribute | E-Id | 
Table 8
| E-Id | Other Elective CourseAttribute | 
Note: The resultant tables are shown in Table 7 and Table 8. Primary Keys have been underlined.
Case 4: Binary Relationship with m: n cardinality
- In this scenario, every student can enroll in more than 1 compulsory course and for a compulsory course there can be more than 1 student.
- First Convert each entity and relationship to tables. Student table corresponds to Student Entity with key as S-Id.
- Similarly Compulsory_Courses table corresponds to Compulsory Courses Entity with key as C-Id.
- Enrolls Table represents relationship between Student and Compulsory_Courses (Which student enrolls in which course). So it will take attribute S-Id from Student and C-Id from Compulsory_Courses.
Table 9
| Student |  |  | Enrolls |  |  | Compulsory_Courses |  | 
| S-Id | Other Student Attribute |  | S-Id | C-Id |  | C-Id | Other Compulsory CourseAttribute | 
| S1 | - |  | S1 | C1 |  | C1 | - | 
| S2 | - |  | S1 | C2 |  | C2 | - | 
| S3 | - |  | S3 | C1 |  | C3 | - | 
| S4 | - |  | S4 | C3 |  | C4 | - | 
|  |  |  | S4 | C2 |  |  |  | 
|  |  |  | S3 | C3 |  |  |  | 
- As we can see from Table 9, S-Id and C-Id both are repeating in Enrolls Table.
- But its combination is unique; so it can be considered as a key of Enrolls table.
Note: All tables’ keys are different, these can’t be merged. Primary Keys of all tables have been underlined.
Case 5: Binary Relationship with weak entity
- In this scenario, an employee can have many dependents and one dependent can depend on one employee.
- A dependent does not have any existence without an employee (e.g; you as a child can be dependent of your father in his company).
- So it will be a weak entity and its participation will always be total. Weak Entity does not have key of its own.
- So its key will be combination of key of its identifying entity (E-Id of Employee in this case) and its partial key (D-Name).
Table 10
| Employee |  |  | Has |  |  | Dependents |  |  | 
| E-Id | Other Employee Attribute |  | E-Id | D-Name |  | D-Name | E-Id | Other DependentsAttribute | 
| E1 | - |  | E1 | RAM |  | RAM | E1 | - | 
| E2 | - |  | E1 | SRINI |  | SRINI | E1 | - | 
| E3 | - |  | E2 | RAM |  | RAM | E2 | - | 
|  |  |  | E3 | ASHISH |  | ASHISH | E3 | - | 
- First Convert each entity and relationship to tables. Employee table corresponds to Employee Entity with key as E-Id.
- Similarly Dependents table corresponds to Dependent Entity with key as D-Name and E-Id.
- Has Table represents relationship between Employee and Dependents (Which employee has which dependents). So it will take attribute E-Id from Employee and D-Name from Dependents.
Table 11
| E-Id | Other Employee Attribute | 
- As we can see from Table 10, E-Id, D-Name is key for Has as well as Dependents Table.
- So we can merge these two into 1.
Table 12
| D-Name | E-Id | Other DependentsAttribute | 
Note: So the resultant tables are shown in Tables 11 and 12. Primary Keys of all tables have been underlined.
