# Attribute Closure in DBMS

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dbms/functional-dependency-and-attribute-closure/

Functional dependency and attribute closure are essential for maintaining data integrity and building effective, organized, and normalized databases. The attribute closure of an attribute set can be defined as a set of attributes that can be functionally determined from it.
- Helps to identify all possible attributes that can be derived from a set of given attributes.
- It can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets.
- Helps in database design by showing how attributes and tables are related, which can improve query performance.
- It becomes complex to manage as the number of attributes and tables increases.
Find the Attribute Closure of an Attribute Set
- Add elements of the attribute set to the result set.
- Recursively add elements to the result set that can be functionally determined from the elements of the result set.
| STUD_NO | STUD_NAME | STUD_PHONE | STUD_STATE | STUD_COUNTRY | STUD_AGE | 
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | JOHN | 2025550147 | California | USA | 20 | 
| 2 | EMMA | 3035550192 | Texas | USA | 19 | 
| 3 | LIAM | 4165550138 | Ontario | Canada | 18 | 
| 4 | SOPHIA | 2075550175 | London | UK | 21 | 
Using FD set of table 1, attribute closure can be determined as:
(STUD_NO)+= {STUD_NO, STUD_NAME, STUD_PHONE, STUD_STATE, STUD_COUNTRY, STUD_AGE}
(STUD_STATE)+ = {STUD_STATE, STUD_COUNTRY}
Find Candidate Keys and Super Keys Using Attribute Closure
- If attribute closure of an attribute set contains all attributes of relation, the attribute set will be super key of the relation.
- If no subset of this attribute set can functionally determine all attributes of the relation, the set will be candidate key as well. For Example, using FD set of table 1
(STUD_NO, STUD_NAME)+ = {STUD_NO, STUD_NAME, STUD_PHONE, STUD_STATE, STUD_COUNTRY, STUD_AGE} 
(STUD_NO)+= {STUD_NO, STUD_NAME, STUD_PHONE, STUD_STATE, STUD_COUNTRY, STUD_AGE} 
(STUD_NO, STUD_NAME) will be super key but not candidate key because its subset (STUD_NO)+ is equal to all attributes of the relation. So, STUD_NO will be a candidate key. 
Prime and Non-Prime Attributes
Attributes which are parts of any candidate key of relation are called as prime attribute, others are non-prime attributes. For Example, STUD_NO in STUDENT relation is prime attribute, others are non-prime attribute.
GATE Questions
Q.1: Consider the relation scheme R = {E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N} and the set of functional dependencies {{E, F} -> {G}, {F} -> {I, J}, {E, H} -> {K, L}, K -> {M}, L -> {N} on R. What is the key for R? (GATE-CS-2014)
A. {E, F} 
B. {E, F, H} 
C. {E, F, H, K, L} 
D. {E} 
Solution:
 Finding attribute closure of all given options, we get: 
{E,F}+ = {EFGIJ} 
{E,F,H}+= {EFHGIJKLMN} 
{E,F,H,K,L}+ =  {EFHGIJKLMN} 
{E}+= {E} 
{EFH}+ and {EFHKL}+ results in set of all attributes, but EFH is minimal. So it will be candidate key. So correct option is (B). 
Q.2: How to check whether an FD can be derived from a given FD set?
Solution:
To check whether an FD A->B can be derived from an FD set F, 
 
- Find (A)+ using FD set F.
- If B is subset of (A)+, then A->B is true else not true.
Q.3: In a schema with attributes A, B, C, D and E following set of functional dependencies are given 
{A -> B, A -> C, CD -> E, B -> D, E -> A} 
Which of the following functional dependencies is NOT implied by the above set? (GATE IT 2005) 
A. CD -> AC 
B. BD -> CD 
C. BC -> CD 
D. AC -> BC 
Solution:
Using FD set given in question, 
(CD)+ = {CDEAB} which means CD -> AC also holds true. 
(BD)+ = {BD} which means BD -> CD can't hold true. So this FD is no implied in FD set. So (B) is the required option. 
Others can be checked in the same way. 
Q.4: Consider a relation scheme R = (A, B, C, D, E, H) on which the following functional dependencies hold: {A–>B, BC–> D, E–>C, D–>A}. What are the candidate keys of R? [GATE 2005]
(a) AE, BE 
(b) AE, BE, DE 
(c) AEH, BEH, BCH 
(d) AEH, BEH, DEH 
Solution:
(AE)+ = {ABECD} which is not set of all attributes. So AE is not a candidate key. Hence option A and B are wrong. 
(AEH)+= {ABCDEH} 
(BEH)+ = {BEHCDA} 
(BCH)+= {BCHDA} which is not set of all attributes. So BCH is not a candidate key. Hence option C is wrong. 
So correct answer is D.
