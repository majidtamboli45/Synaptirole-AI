# Dependency Preserving Decomposition

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dbms/data-base-dependency-preserving-decomposition/

A decomposition of a relation R into R₁, R₂, …, Rₙ is dependency preserving if the union of functional dependencies on the decomposed relations is equivalent to the original set of functional dependencies F.
- Preserves original functional dependencies and allows easy enforcement without costly JOIN operations
- Ensures lossless join so the original relation can be reconstructed without data loss
- Supports normalization to higher normal forms (3NF/BCNF)
- Reduces redundancy, prevents data anomalies, and improves performance and data integrity
Derivation of Dependency Preservation
A decomposition D = {R1, R2,..., Rn } of R is dependency preserving with respect to a set of functional dependencies F if:
(F1 ∪ F2 ∪...∪ Fn )+ = F+
Consider a relation R→F with some functional dependencies.
If R is decomposed into R1 with FD {f1} and R2 with FD {f2}, then there are three cases:
- f 1 ∪ f 2 = F → Dependency preserving
- f 1 ∪ f 2 ⊂ 𝐹 → Not dependency preserving
- f 1 ∪ f 2 ⊃ 𝐹 → Not possible
Problem: 1
Given relation R(A, B, C) with functional dependencies F = { A → B, B → C } and decomposition R₁(A, B), R₂(B, C), determine whether the decomposition is dependency preserving.
Solution: Step 1: Project Dependencies
- On R₁(A, B): A → B
- On R₂(B, C): B → C
So, F′ = { A → B, B → C }
Step 2: Find Closure of F′
From A → B and B → C, we get A → C
F′⁺ = { A → B, B → C, A → C }
Step 3: Compare with Original Closure
Since F′⁺ = F⁺,
The decomposition is dependency preserving.
Problem: 2
Given relation R(A, B, C, D) with functional dependencies F = { AB → C, C → D, D → A } and decomposition R₁(A, B, C), R₂(C, D), determine whether the decomposition is dependency preserving.
Solution: Step 1: Project Dependencies
On R₁(A, B, C):
- AB → C (present)
- From C → D and D → A ⇒ C → A
So, F₁ = { AB → C, C → A }
On R₂(C, D):
- C → D
So, F₂ = { C → D }
Step 2: Union of Dependencies
F₁ ∪ F₂ = { AB → C, C → A, C → D }
Step 3: Check Original Dependencies
- AB → C
- C → D
- D → A (cannot be derived)
Since D → A ∉ (F₁ ∪ F₂)⁺,
The decomposition is NOT dependency preserving.
Question 1: Let R (A, B, C, D) be a relational schema with the following functional dependencies:
A → B, B → C, C → D and D → B. 
The decomposition of R into  (A, B), (B, C), (B, D)
(A) Gives a lossless join, and is dependency preserving
(B) Gives a lossless join, but is not dependency preserving
(C) Does not give a lossless join, but is dependency preserving
(D) Does not give a lossless join and is not dependency preserving

Question 2 R(A, B, C, D) is a relation. Which of the following does not have a lossless join, dependency-preserving BCNF decomposition? 
(A) A->B, B->CD
(B) A->B, B->C, C->D
(C) AB->C, C->AD
(D) A ->BCD
