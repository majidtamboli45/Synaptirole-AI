# Impedance Mismatch in DBMS

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dbms/impedance-mismatch-in-dbms/

In a database management system (DBMS), impedance mismatch refers to the discrepancy between the data structures used in the application code (object model) and those used in the database (relational model). When an application tries to map an object structure (e.g., a class hierarchy in Java or Python) to a relational schema (tables and rows), mismatches can occur due to:
- Differences in data types
- Differences in data organization
- Differences in relationships and access mechanisms
Note: This mismatch can result in complex conversions, performance issues and data inconsistencies.
Example: Suppose you have a Student class in Java:
class Student {
    int id;
    String name;
    Address address;  // another object
}
But in a relational database, the same data would be stored in two tables - Student and Address - linked by a foreign key. Mapping these tables to class objects requires additional effort, leading to impedance mismatch.
Components of the Relational Model
The practical relational model in DBMS consists of three main components:
- Attributes and their Data Types: Define the nature of data stored in each column.
- Tuples: Represent individual rows or records in a table.
- Tables: Represent the overall data structure where tuples are stored.
Note: Mapping these relational components to an object-oriented structure often causes impedance mismatch.
Problems Caused by Impedance Mismatch
1. Data Type Mismatch:
- Different systems support different data types.
- For example, SQL supports CHAR, VARCHAR or NUMERIC, while programming languages like C or Java use types like int, float or string.
- Therefore, binding must exist between each attribute type and its compatible programming data type to prevent conversion errors.
2. Structural Mismatch:
- The result of most SQL queries is a set or multiset of tuples (rows).
- In programming languages, data must be accessed one record at a time.
- Hence, mechanisms like cursors or iterators are used to loop through tuples and extract data into program variables for further processing.
3. Object-Relational Mapping Complexity:
Mapping class hierarchies, inheritance and associations (like one-to-many relationships) into flat relational tables increases complexity and can cause inefficiency in queries and data manipulation.
Solutions to Impedance Mismatch
To reduce or eliminate impedance mismatch, developers use Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tools such as:
- Hibernate (Java)
- Entity Framework (C#/.NET)
- SQLAlchemy (Python)
ORMs act as a bridge between the object-oriented model and the relational model, automating the conversion process and allowing developers to work with objects while the ORM handles SQL generation and data synchronization behind the scenes.
Note: In some cases, special database programming languages like Oracle’s PL/SQL or PostgreSQL’s PL/pgSQL minimize impedance mismatch by integrating procedural logic and SQL in the same environment.
Benefits of Impedance Mismatch
- Increased Flexibility: Applications can use their own data structures, customized to specific requirements.
- Better Performance: Custom data structures may allow for optimized data handling and faster queries.
- Easier Development: Developers can work with familiar object-oriented APIs without constantly writing SQL queries.
Limitations of Impedance Mismatch
- Increased Complexity: Managing mappings between two different models adds development overhead.
- Higher Risk of Errors: Data conversions between structures may lead to inconsistencies or incorrect mappings.
- Limited Functionality: Some DBMS features cannot be fully utilized through object-oriented models, leading to reduced efficiency and higher maintenance.
