# Schema Integration in DBMS

> Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dbms/schema-integration-in-dbms/

In a Database Management System (DBMS), schema integration is the process of combining two or more database schemas into a single unified schema.
- This integrated schema allows data from all original databases to be accessed and managed consistently.
- Schema integration is especially useful for large databases, multiple applications, or data warehousing systems.
- Where individual database schemas are designed separately and then merged to form a global schema.
Note: This approach simplifies management while supporting data sharing, integration, and consistency.
Steps in Schema Integration
1. Identifying Correspondences and Conflicts
When multiple schemas are designed individually, it is important to identify which constructs represent the same real-world concepts and detect conflicts. Common types of conflicts include:
- Naming Conflicts: Synonyms - Different names for the same concept (e.g., CUSTOMER vs CLIENT). Homonyms - Same name for different concepts (e.g., Classes representing TRAIN vs AEROPLANE).
- Type Conflicts: The same concept may be represented differently across schemas (e.g., DEPARTMENT as an entity in one schema and an attribute in another).
- Domain Conflicts: Attributes may have different domains (e.g., Ssn as INTEGER in one schema and STRING in another, or weight in pounds vs kilograms).
- Constraint Conflicts: Constraints like keys may differ across schemas, requiring resolution for integration.
2. Modifying Views to Conform
Some schemas are adjusted to better align with others. This step resolves conflicts identified earlier and ensures the schemas can work together consistently.
3. Merging and Restructuring
The global schema is created by merging individual schemas:
- Schemas are merged or integrated into a global conceptual schema for the entire database.
- Mappings between the source schemas and the global schema are defined.
- This step often requires significant human intervention to resolve conflicts and create a practical, usable global schema.
- Restructuring is an optional step to remove redundancies or simplify the schema.
4. Additional Steps in Schema Integration
- Identify Source Schemas: Determine which databases or data sources will be integrated.
- Analyze Source Schemas: Identify common attributes and structures.
- Define Target Schema: Design a schema to represent the integrated data and support application requirements.
- Map Source to Target: Create mappings between attributes of source schemas and the target schema.
- Merge Schemas: Combine schemas into a single, unified schema.
- Resolve Conflicts: Handle naming, type, domain, and constraint conflicts.
- Test the Integrated Schema: Ensure the schema meets functional requirements and supports accurate querying.
Advantages
- Unified View of Data: A single schema allows users to access and work with data from multiple sources seamlessly.
- Reduced Data Redundancy: Combining schemas minimizes duplication, improving storage efficiency and consistency.
- Improved Productivity: Simplified data management enables faster development and easier data access.
- Enhanced Data Analysis: Integrated data supports better reporting, analytics, and pattern recognition.
Disadvantages
- Complexity: Merging multiple schemas is time-consuming and requires deep understanding of each source schema.
- Data Inconsistencies: Poor integration can lead to inconsistent data or errors in queries.
- Performance Issues: An unoptimized integrated schema may cause slower query responses.
- Security Concerns: Managing access control across multiple integrated sources is more challenging and requires robust security measures.
